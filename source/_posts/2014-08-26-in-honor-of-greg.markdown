A good friend of mine started his own [blog](http://gregkitson.com/) and posted an interesting [easter egg](http://gregkitson.com/blog/2014/08/25/my-favorite-puppet-help-message/).
Being a jealous nerd I had to find something related to chef that would do this. In my search I came up with something for [test-kitchen](http://kitchen.ci).

Stupid octopress couldn't parse it so here's a link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/de5e3290459db361f3dd)
