A good friend of mine started his own [blog](http://gregkitson.com/) and posted an interesting [easter egg](http://gregkitson.com/blog/2014/08/25/my-favorite-puppet-help-message/).
Being a jealous nerd I had to find something related to chef that would do this. In my search I came up with something for [test-kitchen](http://kitchen.ci).

```
11:05:45 ~ > kitchen sink

                    ___
                   ' _ '.
                 / /` `\ \
                 | |   [__]
                 | |    {{
                 | |    }}
              _  | |  _ {{
  ___________<_>_| |_<_>}}________
      .=======^=(___)=^={{====.
     / .----------------}}---. \
    / /                 {{    \ \
   / /                  }}     \ \
  (  '========================='  )
   '-----------------------------'
