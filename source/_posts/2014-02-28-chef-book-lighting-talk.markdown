On February 25th 2014 I did a lighting talk on my [chef-book](https://github.com/jjasghar/chef-book) at [Austin on Rails](http://austinonrails.org/).  It was about
five minutes long, and got a video of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW9njlylhiQ). It's pretty straight forward, and I hope you enjoy it.

PS, I apologize for the quality.
