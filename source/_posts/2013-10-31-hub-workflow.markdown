I recently discovered [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) and man this is really really cool. I'm starting to fork out projects and making PRs, but it seems that when I attempt to use `hub pull-request` I get this error:
```bash
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % hub pull-request
Error creating pull request: Unprocessable Entity (HTTP 422)
Missing field: "head_sha"
Missing field: "base_sha"
No commits between jjasghar:master and jjasghar:blah
```
WTF man? What the hell does this mean? It seems I wasn't the only one that had this [problem](https://github.com/github/hub/issues/189).  It seems that the work flow (at least in my case) was the problem. Here's a quick fix to be able to open up a PR off a forked branch:
```bash
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % git add some_file
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % git commit -m "blah"
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % git push -u origin blah

   5224edf..88ad1af  blah -> blah
Branch blah set up to track remote branch blah from origin.
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % hub pull-request
https://github.com/jjasghar/learning_git/pull/1
```
Pretty slick eh?

Bonus round you can attach your PR to an issue!
```bash
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % hub pull-request -i 3
```
