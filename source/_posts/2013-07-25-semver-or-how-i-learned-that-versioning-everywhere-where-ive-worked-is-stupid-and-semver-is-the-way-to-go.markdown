In the chef world the way that cookbooks are named versioned is something called semver.  Before i watched Jamie Winsor's [Berkself Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYt0E84kYUI) I didn't know understand how the versioning worked.  I quickly discovered http://www.semver.org and fell in love.

TODO.

Seriously, though it really is awesome.
