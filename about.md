JJ works as a Developer Advocate representing the [IBM][ibm] worldwide.
He engages in the IBM's **watson**x service, the Open Source AI ecosystem,
and Kubernetes ecosystem with a focus on Red Hat's OpenShift. He attempts to teach
enterprises and users succesfully skills to onboard to the AI and
Cloud Native ecosystem though he learned his trade in the DevOps ecosystem.
If he isn’t building highlevel automation to streamline
his work, he’s building the groundwork to prepare for that need. He’s been an avid
homelaber and self-hoster of open source software for years and gives
back to that community as much as possible.

He lives and grew up in Austin, Texas. A father and husband, trying to learn
to balance his natural nerdiness with family life. He enjoys
a [good strong dark ale][ale], [hoppy IPA][ipa], some team building
[Artemis][artemis], and epic [Gloomhaven][gloomhaven] campaigning.

He has dove headfirst into Fedora since IBM buying Redhat, but still secretly
wants FreeBSD everywhere. He’s always trying to become a better web technology
developer, though normally just uses `bash` and `python` to get the job done.
