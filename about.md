JJ works as a Developer Advocate representing the [IBM Cloud][ibm] worldwide. He mainly focuses on the IBM Kubernetes Service and OpenShift, trying to make companies and users have a successful onboarding to the Cloud Native ecosystem. He’s also been known in the DevOps tooling ecosystem and generalized Linux communities. If he isn’t building automation to streamline his work, he’s building the groundwork to do just that. He’s been an avid homelab and self-hoster of open source software for years and gives back to that community as much as physically possible.

He lives and grew up in Austin, Texas. A father and husband, trying to learn to balance his natural nerdiness with family life. He enjoys a [good strong dark ale][ale], [hoppy IPA][ipa], some team building [Artemis][artemis], and epic [Gloomhaven][gloomhaven] campaigning.

He has dove headfirst into Fedora since IBM buying Redhat, but still secretly wants FreeBSD everywhere. He’s always trying to become a better web technology developer, though normally just uses `bash` to get the job done.
