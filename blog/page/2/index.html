  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&rsquo;ve been caught up in the <a href="http://docker.io">docker</a>, <a href="http://packer.io">packer</a>, and VM discussion a handful of times. I&rsquo;ve been defending and discussing<em>cough</em>attacking<em>cough</em> different
versions and use cases. Then something happened, something I thought docker is wasn&rsquo;t what it was, and something I thought packer was isn&rsquo;t what it is. Welp, there&rsquo;s some egg on my face eh?
So here&rsquo;s a cheatsheet type post about the difference and <strong>POSSIBLE</strong> use cases.</p>

<h3>docker</h3>

<p>As the docker says in their <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dotCloud/docker-intro-november">intro slide deck</a>, it&rsquo;s designed to &ldquo;ship code.&rdquo; This is important distinction between this and what a VM does.
docker is a souped–up version of <a href="http://linuxcontainers.org/">lxc</a> or to a lesser extent <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/jails.html">freebsd jails</a>. It allows you to
run an application in it&rsquo;s own little bubble, but has a <em>shared</em> underlying OS/kernel. (in this case linux) It allows for a quick provisioning of an application disposable and transient applications
which is great for development work. You can spin up a &ldquo;base&rdquo; build extremely quickly and hack away and it and rollback to a know good spot, without having to reimage/build the machine. In the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>
world this is great for iterations. I guess a good simile is like you have a pad of paper with a base story printed on each page, you tack on the writing you want at the bottom, and if you don&rsquo;t like it just tear it
away and start again.</p>

<h3>VM</h3>

<p>So docker is designed for an application? Isn&rsquo;t that what a VM is designed for? Not exactly. docker shares the kernel and base os, while a VM is it&rsquo;s own entity. VMs also require a hypervisor of some type
that sits on another os; so if you can imagine it, VM = os ontop of hypervisor (that controls the VMs) on top of another os. This has it&rsquo;s merits, but at the same time it can be cumbersome, for development. It seems
VMs use case, compared to something like docker, is more for production deployments, more static content that updates through a deployment system.  This can bring in security uses and the like, keep that in mind.</p>

<h3>packer</h3>

<p>packer in a couple words is this: a way to create base or gold VM images. It&rsquo;s designed to create a typical/transferable VM image that works with multiple platforms and hypervisors. An example, you have a beloved mail server, you create
an image of this box, but you&rsquo;re boss now says you&rsquo;re moving cloud providers and  have to get it working on <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">digital ocean</a>. packer makes that conversion &ldquo;simple,&rdquo; which packs up the image to be portable and transferable.
I say simple mainly because honestly I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, but I have watched a few youtube tutorials on it.</p>

<p>This post is spurred from my miss understanding of the scope of docker and VMs, and in the process of groking them, rediscovering packer.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell: docker is a wrapper for lxc/jails for linux running an app sharing a common kernel, VMs are separate entities and kernels that more production focused, and packer is a way to create transferable VMs between hypervisors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something that I never seemed to grok was <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_handlers.html">chef handlers</a>. I read that site like 50 times, got the jist, but never fully understood them.</p>

<p>Then I learned it in a nutshell: you know when you run <code>chef-client</code> or <code>chef-solo</code> and that error that pops up? A handler can export it to another location so you can have a centralized stream of information.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t just limited to error reporting, you can report a bunch of stuff, but errors are something that admins should visualize ASAP.</p>

<p>This is AMAZINGLY useful if you have more than a couple nodes. Lets say you have 100-200ish nodes (like me) and you decided that you wanted to run <code>knife ssh 'chef_environment:staging' 'sudo chef-client'</code>.</p>

<p>Awesome, so it kicks off, you have a few changes but you had a typo in your <code>role[db_slave]</code>. Well, if you&rsquo;ve ever used <code>knife ssh</code> before you&rsquo;ll know that it streams everything real-time
and you&rsquo;ll probably miss the nasty red text that says you have an error. If you have your handler; it takes it says &ldquo;Hey error here, lets push it up to [email|campfire|growl|hipchat|etc]&rdquo; and boom everyone knows that
there&rsquo;s a problem with the converge. If you are lucky enough to have a regular checkin with the chef-server you&rsquo;ll get the error pop up each run till you have it fixed. Annoying yes, but it makes sure you have all you machines
in a good state.</p>

<p>If this has peaked your interest, there is a cookbook called <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef_handler">chef_handler</a> that does most if not all of your heavy lifting. It leverages an LWRP that needs to be close if not the first in your <code>run_list</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example for <a href="https://github.com/kisoku/chef-handler-mail">chef-handler-mail</a>:</p>

<p>As you can see it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>My company uses <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">campfire</a> and there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/ampledata/chef-handler-campfire">chef-handler-campfire</a> gem for it. The LWRP stanza that you put in your recipe requires something to this effect, I put this in the
first main internal recipe:</p>

<p>Note: Unfortunately the newest <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/tinder">tinder</a> requires <code>json ~&gt; '1.8.0'</code> and chef <code>11.8.2</code> requires <code>json ~&gt; '1.7.7'</code>.  Last night (2014-02-06) chef <a href="http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/02/06/chef-client-11-10-0-release/">released 11.10</a> which fixes this, the embedded chef binary now uses 1.8.0. I have a <a href="https://github.com/ampledata/chef-handler-campfire/pull/2">PR</a> to fix up the README.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to handlers, but for now this is huge win for me, I&rsquo;ll post more as I start learning the reporting side of it.</p>

<p>Wow, what the hell does that mean?</p>

<p>So after some investigation it seems that I had my <code>/opt/splunk/bin/splunk</code> symlinked to <code>/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk</code>. After some finagling with splunk support it seems it was a complete
oversight.</p>

<p>Having both the <code>splunkforwarder</code> and <code>splunk</code> on the same box can be dangerous, if you do you&rsquo;ll have to edit the ports that they use. Keep that in mind if you decide to go down this path.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So over the 2013 holiday break I played around with <a href="http://boxen.github.com/">boxen</a>, I even wrote a couple beginner posts on it. If you want go check them out, I&rsquo;ll wait&hellip;..</p>

<p>So, yeah, you can tell I was pretty impressed with it right?</p>

<p>Well from a guy that uses <a href="http://getchef.com">chef</a> day in and day out, using it in a real life scenario it was a nightmare.</p>

<p>First off, I can understand some of the choices they made; like putting everything in <code>/opt/boxen</code>. Alas the disadvantage is that well EVERYTHING is in <code>/opt/boxen</code>. My company leverages <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> for all our base development software, and it seems that boxen installs the binary at <code>/opt/boxen/homebrew</code>. This in turn confuses the hell out of the seasoned admin AND the new person developer trying just do a simple <code>brew install &lt;someapp&gt;</code>. No joke, I spent 2-3 hours trying to figure out why boxen said homebrew was installed but I couldn&rsquo;t simplify just use <code>brew</code>. I ended up symlinking like crazy not realizing that I hand to <code>source /opt/boxen/script/env.sh</code>.  Turns out it seems I completely missed that small note in the docs/wrapper script, saying you need to source it. <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>Along with that nasty turn, one of the selling points was my ability to <code>git clone</code> down my companies code from Github. Yeah that didn&rsquo;t work at all. I forgot how hard it was to make a damn directory with puppet, then to use the <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-repository">puppet-repository</a> and have it fall on it&rsquo;s face only frustrated me even farther. Strike two boxen, strike two.</p>

<p>The final strike came pretty simply but I didn&rsquo;t realize how much of a pain it was. The <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-mysql">puppet-mysql</a> runs it&rsquo;s socket file in both a completely different location and runs a completely nonstandard port to connect to it. Now to a sysadmin like myself, this seems negligible, neigh, not even negligible,  but put this in front of a Developer that has to change his <code>database.yml</code> and all hell breaks loose.   And to top that off, because the database.yml is part of the code base, if said Dev decides to push it back upstream it opens up a can of worms asking why we have to have something like the following for everyone:</p>

<p>Yeah that ain&rsquo;t worth it AT ALL.  Now that I&rsquo;ve got my bitching out of the way, on to the happiness that is chef.</p>

<p>I took what I learned from boxen, and took the plunge into chef-solo to fix this issue. I recalled attempting to use chef-solo on OSX when I first started and it was also complete disaster. I&rsquo;m betting I really had no idea what I was doing so that&rsquo;s probably a major factor in it. But now I feel have mastered it on &ldquo;the linuxes&rdquo;, and hell even wrote a sensu cookbook for windows, so I told myself to take the plunge.  Man, I&rsquo;m really glad I did; TL;DR: easy pezzy.</p>

<p>I started around noon after deciding that boxen was dead, and by 3pm I had a working framework with a <a href="http://bit.ly/jj_mac">wrapper script</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/homebrew">homebrew</a>, and <a href="http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/08/02/adventures-with-chef-solo/">chef-solo</a>, why oh why didn&rsquo;t I do this originally.</p>

<p>(I pinged Fletcher Nichol about getting test-kitchen working with OSX, he sent me a gist on how to get it working, as of writing this I haven&rsquo;t attempted it yet, but hellz yes I&rsquo;m gonna kitchen this bitch up very very soon.)</p>

<p>I had some trouble with <a href="http://rvm.io">rvm</a>, automating the install was a bit tricky, but breaking it up into different <code>execute</code> and <code>bash</code> blocks allowed for solidarity. After that hooking up the <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/dmg">dmg</a> cookbook and boom, I have my <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/provision_mac">mac provisioning</a> system.</p>

<p>Take a look, I&rsquo;m honestly curious on what people think. Oh, take out the <code>repo.rb</code> though, it&rsquo;s specific to my company.</p>

<p>NOTE: Yes, that is a fake ip, and yes that server Exception isn&rsquo;t tied just to apache2.</p>

<p>If you have, you know my pain.  Turns out there is a <a href="https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4253">ticket</a> on this and also a couple <a href="http://sanketdangi.com/post/50897416859/chef-errors-and-their-solutions">blog posts</a> also.</p>

<p>The gist of this:</p>

<blockquote><p>This error is encountered when we have large chef recipes whose deployment time on clients is large than 15 minutes. In order to avoid this error, please increase “s3_url_ttl&#8221; value from 900 seconds to required time interval</p></blockquote>

<p>So the fix is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>~<span class="o">]</span> % sudo vim /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># add this line: erchef[‘s3_url_ttl’] = 900 where 900 is something larger...maybe 1800?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>~<span class="o">]</span> % sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Boom, you should be good now. No more damn 403s.</p>

<h1>Update!</h1>

<p>So it seems that with release of <code>11.10</code> the 403 error has&hellip;morphed. Now it looks something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>---------------------------------------
</span><span class='line'>Response body length 164 does not match HTTP Content-Length header 206.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I was lazy, like all good sysadmins&hellip;I wanted to put in an option to say &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo; in a bash script.</p>

<p>I started with a simple <code>if..then..elif..else</code> statement, then I started googling around and found multiple ways to do it.</p>

<p>I ran the script a couple times, it worked like a charm, but without thinking about it I put <code>y</code> instead of the suggested <code>yes</code> and it <code>exit 1</code>ed me.  Do&#8217;h!</p>

<p>I continued googling around and then remembered the <code>case</code> statement.</p>

<p>Now you are probably wondering why I even bothered posting this. Honestly, I spent way too much time on this and I figured I&rsquo;ll find myself looking for this again 6+ months down the line.</p>

<p>Hopefully this post will save you some time in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My goal is to get these few apps on my vm, but first lets get a default build working:</p>

<ul>
<li>iterm2</li>
<li>dropbox</li>
<li>mysql</li>
<li>1password</li>
<li>virtualbox</li>
<li>vagrant</li>
<li>chrome</li>
</ul>


<p>With my <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen">fork</a>&hellip;now it&rsquo;s time to start messing around with it. Go ahead and click <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/tree/master/modules/people">here</a> this is for personal manifests. This is something I&rsquo;ll cover in the second half of this post. As I was walking through this, it seems that &ldquo;projects&rdquo; are just a shared collection of manifests also. So if you learn how to make a personal manifest, a project on isn&rsquo;t much more!</p>

<p>Where we want to start is at the default <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/blob/master/manifests/site.pp">site.pp</a> this is what will be installed on all your boxes by well, default.</p>

<p>Ok, first thing first, get a base image running again, open up terminal, and checkout boxen from your fork, (this is my fork and the commands I use from a base install):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>[/opt/boxen/repo/manifests] % vim site.pp</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I don&rsquo;t care for nodejs or the older versions of ruby for this example, so I&rsquo;m going to remove lines 66-69 and 72,73 of that site.pp file. If you noticed I created a branch for this too, so I&rsquo;ll push this up to my repo so I can track my work.</p>

<p>Ok, lets give boxen a shot!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>[/opt/boxen/repo/] % boxen</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a warning about auto-update, that&rsquo;s fine, you are developing manifests right?</p>

<p>Go ahead and run these commands on the command line, if our changes worked as expected it should say:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Hell yes! We got what we expected! Ok, go ahead and commit your changes so you can track your work, and push the branch up if you want to be completely safe.</p>

<h2>Per user manifests</h2>

<p>Ok, go ahead and go to that <code>modules/people</code> and read that <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/tree/master/modules/people">README.md</a> so you get some background.</p>

<p>Ok here&rsquo;s the one I created:</p>

<p>Nice! Ok, now we need to create:</p>

<p>Ok, now you need to add these to the <code>Puppetfile</code> located at the root of the boxen repo</p>

<p>After you update the <code>Puppetfile</code> go ahead and run <code>boxen</code> again:</p>

<p>Grats! You got everything installed. This is just the start, but you can see the beauty of this now. Or at least I could.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Note: Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/awaxa/">Greg Kitson</a> as my sounding board and inspiration here to get this done.</p>

<p>So I started watching a couple videos on <a href="http://boxen.github.com">boxen</a> both are done by <a href="https://twitter.com/wfarr">@wfarr</a> and he&rsquo;s convinced me to give it a shot. Here is the &ldquo;first&rdquo; part of me getting up a dev env to play around with it.</p>

<p>I think the thing that got me was the &ldquo;one line cURL&rdquo; that you can run which is from <a href="https://github.com/boxen/boxen-web">boxen-web</a> so that&rsquo;s my ultimate goal here; ok lets start this off.</p>

<p>First thing, read the <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> and something jumps out at me straight off the bat:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>Boxen may not play nice with an existing homebrew install.
</span><span class='line'>Boxen may not play nice with an existing nvm install.
</span><span class='line'>Boxen recommends installing the full Xcode.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>sigh</em> So this means I need a vm to start playing with this. I chose virtualbox as my hypervisor. The trick is; you can only virtualize OS X on OS X so get it installed on your mac ;).</p>

<p>It seems there is a Mavericks network issue with <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=58036">virtualbox 4.2</a> so I suggest updating to the latest before going any farther. I ran into a problem with the network adapter and the install wizard wouldn&rsquo;t get farther than Manual/DHCP network setup. <em>grrr</em></p>

<p>Ok, so I&rsquo;m writing this real time&hellip;yeah this blew up. So I converted to <a href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_fusion/6_0">VMware Fusion 6</a> to attempt to build the box. Lets see how that goes.</p>

<p>So tricky VMware Fusion, it says it&rsquo;s designed for Windows, but you can use the Install.App you got from the Mac App store. When it asks for an image to install from, just point it there!</p>

<p>Spin up a machine like it suggests and get a base image installed. Go ahead shut it down here, take a snapshot it as &ldquo;base install or something&rdquo; so you can roll back here because you&rsquo;re using a provisioning software and you need a clean box right? RIGHT? (yes yes vagrant would be perfect here, but that&rsquo;s another cost got get it working with fusion)</p>

<p>After you got that done boot up the vm open terminal run the following:</p>

<p><code>git --version</code></p>

<p>This should prompt you to install the &ldquo;mac cli tools&rdquo; without needing to install Xcode. Badass.</p>

<p>Go ahead and fork <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">our-boxen</a> like it suggests. Now if you want this to be private, for your company..(I&rsquo;m not doing because I&rsquo;m trying to learn this), you have to go through the following:</p>

<p>This deploys the default boxen setup like the README.md says, customizing is in a following post.</p>

<p>Ok, now try out boxen:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>/opt/boxen/repo<span class="o">]</span> % ./script/boxen
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Alas this will probably bitch about no Full Disk Encryption, so you&rsquo;ll need to run (good for developing this):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It should ask you for your github credentials (yes it works with two factor authentication), then you should start seeing a bunch of stuff on the screen!</p>

<p>NOTE: you might see it get stuck at <code>Dnsmasq</code> for a default run. If you check activity monitor it is running and talking to Greg, it seems that&rsquo;s gcc/make compiling something in the background. This might take a long time, wait it out.</p>

<p>Grats you have successfully started up boxen and got it running. Now lets customize it, that should be the following post&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So congrats you got your new &ldquo;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/">Private Cloud</a>&rdquo; from Rackspace. You are probably ecstatic to start building your new machines.
I know I was; but alas with all new toys sometimes you hit a couple stags. Here are a couple things I ran into on my first few days.</p>

<h3>First issue</h3>

<p>So I&rsquo;m a chef shop, as you might know by now (assuming you&rsquo;ve read any of my other posts). I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace">knife-rackspace</a> tons of times; and hell I even have a <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace/commits?author=jjasghar">commit bit</a>. So logically I thought I could leverage this same gem with different backend api points. Nope, I was hard core wrong.
You end up having to install <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-openstack">knife-openstack</a>. That in itself isn&rsquo;t bad at all&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>~<span class="o">]</span> % gem install knife-openstack
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you need to update your <code>knife.rb</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>~<span class="o">]</span> % vim ~/.chef/knife.rb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In your handoff ticket, you probably got something that looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>Go ahead and copy them out to what they need to be, something like&hellip;</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s not a lot of help eh? Turns out, if you look at the ticket that Rackspace gives you and what the <code>[:openstack_auth_url]</code> requires you&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s a <code>/tokens</code> at the end. Do&#8217;h!</p>

<h3>Second issue</h3>

<p>Ok, so you got the ability to talk to your backend? Yay! But alas, you run your create&hellip;</p>

<p>What the hell does that mean? Well I&rsquo;m not going to explain it all but it seems that by default Rackspace names the &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo; networks as &ldquo;Fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Floating.&rdquo;
This is triggered a fog issue, where it&rsquo;s looking at the label for a network either &ldquo;public&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; and blows up. There is a ticket in for this <a href="https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE-231">here</a> but it looks like it&rsquo;s stalled from late summer, early fall. Lammmeeee.</p>

<p>So you are probably saying &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just rename them?&rdquo; Good for you, great idea&hellip;but no, Openstack doesn&rsquo;t support that. So at this time, it looks like you&rsquo;ll have to delete them and rebuild them with the &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo; names. Hopefully you&rsquo;ve noticed this at just the begining of building out your machines, otherwise you&rsquo;ll have to nuke and pave everything you&rsquo;ve done to get the new networks in.</p>

<p>Ah!, almost forgot. Before you go I should mention a quick note, notice the lowercase p in both public and private. Yes, it&rsquo;s THAT picky&hellip;</p>

It&rsquo;s called <em>Git for Ages 4 and Up</em>.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest taking the 99ish mins to watch it, it&rsquo;s a great tutorial, with great visual examples.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also stolen some aliases that he suggests!</p>

<p>Some useful notes that this video helped clear up for me:</p>

<p>Something else that finally cleared up to me <code>origin/master</code> means a label, while <code>origin master</code> means the remote origin with the label of master on it&rsquo;s remote side. This works with <code>origin/bugfix</code> and <code>origin bugfix</code> also, it&rsquo;s just unfortunate that the master is used twice is a very similar context.</p>

<p><code>git merge master</code> merges master into the current branch you have checked out. <code>git merge origin/master</code> merges the upstream changes of master into your current branch. <code>git merge master bugfix</code> merges the master branch into bugfix explicitly.</p>

<p><code>git push --set-upstream (or -u) origin bugfix</code> sets the upstream branch on origin to bugfix, if from your local repo.</p>

<p><code>refs/head/blah</code> is a fancy way of saying <code>blah</code> is the branch.</p>

<p><code>git push origin --tags</code> to push your tags on the local repo to the origin</p>

<p>A detached HEAD isn&rsquo;t a bad thing; it just means there&rsquo;s no branch associated with it. It&rsquo;s good to check things out but you can always <code>git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> if needed.</p>

<p><code>git rebase -i HEAD^^</code> go back to rebase 2 commits; rebase goes bottom up, to squash up to the top one.</p>

<p><code>rebase</code> creates a <em>new</em> line of history, not REWRITES history.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve pushed, never rebase; it&rsquo;s not worth it. :(</p>
