    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>git rebasing or fixing an auto merge conflict</h2>

<p>In my adventures with openstack and gerrit reviews I sometimes see something to the effect of: <em>Patch in Merge Conflict</em></p>

<p>This makes me very sad. I hate these things, and to quote Mark Vanderwiel, it&rsquo;s basically like someone snuck in a change before you.</p>

<p>We had a great conversation about it <a href="http://youtu.be/wsWj_NQJKI0?t=3m50s">here</a> for about 3 mins, but if you want a tl;dw (watch) it&rsquo;s this:
<code>bash
$ git remote update
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git checkout $BRANCH_THAT_YOUR_FIXING
$ git rebase master
$ # Fix any conflicts that should pop up
$ git add $ANY_CONFLICTS
$ git rebase --continue
$ git commit --amend
$ git review -R
</code>
It looks like a lot, but all in all not bad at all. The rebasing might look scary but walk through each conflict, edit it and add it back you should be fine.</p>

<h2>Detached head what the hell does that mean?</h2>

<p>If you continue watching that video we start to talk about detached heads. If you have played in the openstack/gerrit world you&rsquo;ll notice a copy paste off a review by download, something like:
<code>bash
$ git fetch https://review.openstack.org/stackforge/cookbook-openstack-client refs/changes/65/126365/9 &amp;&amp; git checkout FETCH_HEAD
</code>
Needless to say this is confusing as all hell. Not to mention when you finish it is says something like:</p>

<p>```bash
You are in &lsquo;detached HEAD&rsquo; state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.</p>

<p>If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:</p>

<p>  git checkout -b new_branch_name</p>

<p>HEAD is now at 789cb70&hellip; Initial Commit of the cookbook-openstack-client
```</p>

<p>Seriously what the hell does this mean? Luckily it&rsquo;s actually not a bad thing at all. If you watch from <a href="http://youtu.be/wsWj_NQJKI0?t=8m10s">here</a> for about 2 minutes you&rsquo;ll see us talk about it. The short of it is, you&rsquo;ve pulled down the patch, but it&rsquo;s not attached (detached) to your local master/other branch. When you do the <code>git checkout -b branch_name</code> off of master/other branch, it connects it up so it&rsquo;s no longer detached.</p>

<p>After saying it out loud, or typing it out as i just did, it makes sense, but surprisingly no one ever told me such a simple concept. I hope this helps someone down the line.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/09/25/checking-active-branche-in-multiple-repos</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/stackforge/?query=cookbook-openstack">repos</a> that I have to watch over and make patches against.
Trying to figure out what branch I left checked out can be&hellip;well frustrating.
I put all my <a href="http://www.openstack.org">openstack</a> repos in a sub directory from my standard <code>~/repo/</code> directory. I wanted to figure out a way to check all the active branches that I had  checked out; and it turns out that it was hellva a lot more challanging that expected.</p>

<p>As a sysadmin, you probably say ok, <code>git branch | awk '/\*/ { print $2; }'</code> seems ok, but man that&rsquo;s a bitch to write.</p>

<p>Leveraging a little bit of googling <code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code> appeared which does the exact same. Odd that there
isn&rsquo;t easier command.</p>

<p>So putting it all together I come up with something like the following to tell me what the active branch is for each of
my repos. This is a quick one liner that does the trick for me.</p>

<p><code>bash
for i in *; do cd $i ; pwd; git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD ; cd ../ ; done
</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So as with all modern day &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; guys I use a SCM [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Control_Management">Source Control Management</a>] system on a daily if not hourly basis.  I&rsquo;ve been attempting to learn it more and more, and I came across this video from the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/git">/r/git</a> subreddit and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen a better explanation. It&rsquo;s called <em>Git for Ages 4 and Up</em>.</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ffBJ4sVUb4 "></iframe></div></p>

<p>I strongly suggest taking the 99ish mins to watch it, it&rsquo;s a great tutorial, with great visual examples.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also stolen some aliases that he suggests!
<code>bash
alias glp="git log --graph --pretty --all"
alias gld="git log --graph --decorate --all"
</code></p>

<p>Some useful notes that this video helped clear up for me:</p>

<p>Something else that finally cleared up to me <code>origin/master</code> means a label, while <code>origin master</code> means the remote origin with the label of master on it&rsquo;s remote side. This works with <code>origin/bugfix</code> and <code>origin bugfix</code> also, it&rsquo;s just unfortunate that the master is used twice is a very similar context.</p>

<p><code>git merge master</code> merges master into the current branch you have checked out. <code>git merge origin/master</code> merges the upstream changes of master into your current branch. <code>git merge master bugfix</code> merges the master branch into bugfix explicitly.</p>

<p><code>git push --set-upstream (or -u) origin bugfix</code> sets the upstream branch on origin to bugfix, if from your local repo.</p>

<p><code>refs/head/blah</code> is a fancy way of saying <code>blah</code> is the branch.</p>

<p><code>git push origin --tags</code> to push your tags on the local repo to the origin</p>

<p>A detached HEAD isn&rsquo;t a bad thing; it just means there&rsquo;s no branch associated with it. It&rsquo;s good to check things out but you can always <code>git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> if needed.</p>

<p><code>git rebase -i HEAD^^</code> go back to rebase 2 commits; rebase goes bottom up, to squash up to the top one.</p>

<p><code>rebase</code> creates a <em>new</em> line of history, not REWRITES history.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve pushed, never rebase; it&rsquo;s not worth it. :(</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/github/hub">hub</a> and man this is really really cool. I&rsquo;m starting to fork out projects and making PRs, but it seems that when I attempt to use <code>hub pull-request</code> I get this error:
<code>bash
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % hub pull-request
Error creating pull request: Unprocessable Entity (HTTP 422)
Missing field: "head_sha"
Missing field: "base_sha"
No commits between jjasghar:master and jjasghar:blah
</code>
WTF man? What the hell does this mean? It seems I wasn&rsquo;t the only one that had this <a href="https://github.com/github/hub/issues/189">problem</a>.  It seems that the work flow (at least in my case) was the problem. Here&rsquo;s a quick fix to be able to open up a PR off a forked branch:
<code>bash
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % git add some_file
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % git commit -m "blah"
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % git push -u origin blah

   5224edf..88ad1af  blah -&gt; blah
Branch blah set up to track remote branch blah from origin.
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % hub pull-request
https://github.com/jjasghar/learning_git/pull/1
</code>
Pretty slick eh?</p>

<p>Bonus round you can attach your PR to an issue!
<code>bash
[~/repo/learning_git/fakedir1] % hub pull-request -i 3
</code></p>
