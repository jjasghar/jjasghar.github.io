    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love git. Honestly, I really do, hell I even have a sticker on my laptop.
Unfortunately <a href="http://canonical.com">Canonical</a> choose something different
called <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/">bazaar</a>. It&rsquo;s supposed to be easier,
the jury is still out on that for my opinion; but it really is a tad bit different.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m putting a collection of commands here, so if you decided you&rsquo;d like to put in
a &ldquo;PR&rdquo; or in <a href="https://launchpad.net/">launchpad</a>&rsquo;s term &ldquo;Propose for merging&rdquo; merge.</p>

<p>Lets say you&rsquo;ve found a typo and you&rsquo;d like to fix it; something like <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~d-jj/ironic/ironic-conductor/+merge/253085">this</a>.</p>

<p>These steps assume you have a launchpad id and account set up correctly, and all you
want to do is push up a change to an issue you&rsquo;ve found.</p>

<p>First be sure to login to launchpad:</p>

<p><code>bash
~ &gt; bzr launchpad-login &lt;username&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Then you clone down the code locally with this, NOTE: ubuntu/ironic can be anything on launchpad.</p>

<p><code>bash
~ &gt; bzr branch lp:ubuntu/ironic
</code></p>

<p>Then <code>checkout</code> the repo into a branch you can work on, NOTE: ironic-conductor will create a directory you will work in</p>

<p><code>bash
~ &gt; bzr checkout lp:ubuntu/ironic ironic-conductor
</code></p>

<p>Then you need to &lsquo;link&rsquo; the local working directory with your launchpad account, NOTE: this&rsquo;ll push up the initial branch to launchpad.</p>

<p><code>bash
~ &gt; cd ironic-conductor
ironic-conductor &gt; bzr branch --stacked --switch lp:ubuntu/ironic lp:~d-jj/ironic/ironic-conductor
</code></p>

<p>Make your changes!</p>

<p><code>bash
ironic-conductor &gt; # I'm doing awesome changes now, rm -rf my_file and blah blah blah
</code></p>

<p>Sanity check your changes:</p>

<p><code>bash
ironic-conductor &gt; bzr diff
</code></p>

<p>Yep, looks good, lets commit:</p>

<p><code>bash
ironic-conductor &gt; bzr commit -m "I did some amazing changes and this is that commit"
</code></p>

<p>If everything goes to plan you should see something like:
<code>
Most recent Ubuntu version: 2015.1~b2-0ubuntu1
Packaging branch status: CURRENT
Committing to: bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/~d-jj/ironic/ironic-conductor/
modified debian/ironic-conductor.init.in
Committed revision 14.
</code></p>

<p>Ok, so now if you go to your launchpad you should see the push, now go to the project and click that
<code>Propose for merging</code> link.</p>

<p>Under &ldquo;Target Branch&rdquo; place the active branch under development, also add a note to the &ldquo;Description of Change&rdquo;
so you have a blurb on what it does. Click &ldquo;Propose Merge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that I constantly get it backwards, so be wary of that; you may have to re-propose the merge if the
diffs look wrong. You can do this from the page after the &ldquo;Propose Merge.&rdquo; If someone figures out how to get it
right the first time please ping me: @jjasghar on twitter, I&rsquo;d love to see the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way to do this.</p>

<p>Also for that matter, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a way to do this without using the site, there&rsquo;s gotta be a CLI
only version of this.</p>

<p>Here are some links I looked at I was figuring this out:</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/01/25/boxen-is-neat-but-man-chef-solo-was-so-much-easier</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So over the 2013 holiday break I played around with <a href="http://boxen.github.com/">boxen</a>, I even wrote a couple beginner posts on it. If you want go check them out, I&rsquo;ll wait&hellip;..</p>

<p>So, yeah, you can tell I was pretty impressed with it right?</p>

<p>Well from a guy that uses <a href="http://getchef.com">chef</a> day in and day out, using it in a real life scenario it was a nightmare.</p>

<p>First off, I can understand some of the choices they made; like putting everything in <code>/opt/boxen</code>. Alas the disadvantage is that well EVERYTHING is in <code>/opt/boxen</code>. My company leverages <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> for all our base development software, and it seems that boxen installs the binary at <code>/opt/boxen/homebrew</code>. This in turn confuses the hell out of the seasoned admin AND the new person developer trying just do a simple <code>brew install &lt;someapp&gt;</code>. No joke, I spent 2-3 hours trying to figure out why boxen said homebrew was installed but I couldn&rsquo;t simplify just use <code>brew</code>. I ended up symlinking like crazy not realizing that I hand to <code>source /opt/boxen/script/env.sh</code>.  Turns out it seems I completely missed that small note in the docs/wrapper script, saying you need to source it. <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>Along with that nasty turn, one of the selling points was my ability to <code>git clone</code> down my companies code from Github. Yeah that didn&rsquo;t work at all. I forgot how hard it was to make a damn directory with puppet, then to use the <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-repository">puppet-repository</a> and have it fall on it&rsquo;s face only frustrated me even farther. Strike two boxen, strike two.</p>

<p>The final strike came pretty simply but I didn&rsquo;t realize how much of a pain it was. The <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-mysql">puppet-mysql</a> runs it&rsquo;s socket file in both a completely different location and runs a completely nonstandard port to connect to it. Now to a sysadmin like myself, this seems negligible, neigh, not even negligible,  but put this in front of a Developer that has to change his <code>database.yml</code> and all hell breaks loose.   And to top that off, because the database.yml is part of the code base, if said Dev decides to push it back upstream it opens up a can of worms asking why we have to have something like the following for everyone:
```ruby
&lt;%
  socket = [</p>

<pre><code>ENV["BOXEN_MYSQL_SOCKET"],
"/var/run/mysql5/mysqld.sock",
"/tmp/mysql.sock"
</code></pre>

<p>  ].detect { |f| f &amp;&amp; File.exist?(f) }</p>

<p>  port = ENV[&ldquo;BOXEN_MYSQL_PORT&rdquo;] || &ldquo;3306&rdquo;
%></p>

<p>development: &amp;development
  adapter: mysql
  database: yourapp_development
  username: root
&lt;% if socket %>
  host: localhost
  socket: &lt;%= socket %>
&lt;% else %>
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: &lt;%= port %>
&lt;% end %></p>

<h1>Warning: The database defined as &ldquo;test&rdquo; will be erased and</h1>

<h1>re-generated from your development database when you run &ldquo;rake&rdquo;.</h1>

<h1>Do not set this db to the same as development or production.</h1>

<p>test:
  &lt;&lt;: *development
  database: yourapp_test
```</p>

<p>Yeah that ain&rsquo;t worth it AT ALL.  Now that I&rsquo;ve got my bitching out of the way, on to the happiness that is chef.</p>

<p>I took what I learned from boxen, and took the plunge into chef-solo to fix this issue. I recalled attempting to use chef-solo on OSX when I first started and it was also complete disaster. I&rsquo;m betting I really had no idea what I was doing so that&rsquo;s probably a major factor in it. But now I feel have mastered it on &ldquo;the linuxes&rdquo;, and hell even wrote a sensu cookbook for windows, so I told myself to take the plunge.  Man, I&rsquo;m really glad I did; TL;DR: easy pezzy.</p>

<p>I started around noon after deciding that boxen was dead, and by 3pm I had a working framework with a <a href="http://bit.ly/jj_mac">wrapper script</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/homebrew">homebrew</a>, and <a href="http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/08/02/adventures-with-chef-solo/">chef-solo</a>, why oh why didn&rsquo;t I do this originally.</p>

<p>(I pinged Fletcher Nichol about getting test-kitchen working with OSX, he sent me a gist on how to get it working, as of writing this I haven&rsquo;t attempted it yet, but hellz yes I&rsquo;m gonna kitchen this bitch up very very soon.)</p>

<p>I had some trouble with <a href="http://rvm.io">rvm</a>, automating the install was a bit tricky, but breaking it up into different <code>execute</code> and <code>bash</code> blocks allowed for solidarity. After that hooking up the <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/dmg">dmg</a> cookbook and boom, I have my <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/provision_mac">mac provisioning</a> system.</p>

<p>Take a look, I&rsquo;m honestly curious on what people think. Oh, take out the <code>repo.rb</code> though, it&rsquo;s specific to my company.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/01/20/a-chef-error-that-has-haunted-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, you may have seen this before:
<code>ruby
23.987.33.854   * cookbook_file[/etc/init.d/apache2] action create
23.987.33.854 ================================================================================
23.987.33.854 Error executing action `create` on resource 'cookbook_file[/etc/init.d/apache2]'
23.987.33.854 ================================================================================
23.987.33.854
23.987.33.854
23.987.33.854 Net::HTTPServerException
23.987.33.854 ------------------------
23.987.33.854 403 "Forbidden"
23.987.33.854
23.987.33.854
</code></p>

<p>NOTE: Yes, that is a fake ip, and yes that server Exception isn&rsquo;t tied just to apache2.</p>

<p>If you have, you know my pain.  Turns out there is a <a href="https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4253">ticket</a> on this and also a couple <a href="http://sanketdangi.com/post/50897416859/chef-errors-and-their-solutions">blog posts</a> also.</p>

<p>The gist of this:</p>

<blockquote><p>This error is encountered when we have large chef recipes whose deployment time on clients is large than 15 minutes. In order to avoid this error, please increase “s3_url_ttl" value from 900 seconds to required time interval</p></blockquote>

<p>So the fix is:
```bash
[~] % sudo vim /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb</p>

<h1>add this line: erchef[‘s3_url_ttl’] = 900 where 900 is something larger&hellip;maybe 1800?</h1>

<p>[~] % sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure
```</p>

<p>Boom, you should be good now. No more damn 403s.</p>

<h1>Update!</h1>

<p>So it seems that with release of <code>11.10</code> the 403 error has&hellip;morphed. Now it looks something like:
```</p>

<h2>Chef::Exceptions::ContentLengthMismatch</h2>

<p>Response body length 164 does not match HTTP Content-Length header 206.
```</p>

<p>I have a post about it from 2014-03-19</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/01/18/because-googling-failed-me-for-yes-or-no-bash-scripting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I was lazy, like all good sysadmins&hellip;I wanted to put in an option to say &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo; in a bash script.</p>

<p>I started with a simple <code>if..then..elif..else</code> statement, then I started googling around and found multiple ways to do it.</p>

<p>I ran the script a couple times, it worked like a charm, but without thinking about it I put <code>y</code> instead of the suggested <code>yes</code> and it <code>exit 1</code>ed me.  Do'h!</p>

<p>I continued googling around and then remembered the <code>case</code> statement.</p>

<p>I created this:
```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>read -p &ldquo;yes or no: &rdquo; RESPONSE</p>

<p>case &ldquo;$RESPONSE&rdquo; in
  yes|y|Yes|Y)</p>

<pre><code>echo "blah is yes"
;;
</code></pre>

<p>  no|n|No|N)</p>

<pre><code>echo "blah is no"
;;
</code></pre>

<p>  *)</p>

<pre><code>echo "You need to say yes or no, start over!"
exit 1
;;
</code></pre>

<p>esac
```
Now you are probably wondering why I even bothered posting this. Honestly, I spent way too much time on this and I figured I&rsquo;ll find myself looking for this again 6+ months down the line.</p>

<p>Hopefully this post will save you some time in the future.</p>

    <link href="http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/01/01/customizing-boxen/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-01T13:27:20-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/01/01/customizing-boxen</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My goal is to get these few apps on my vm, but first lets get a default build working:</p>

<ul>
<li>iterm2</li>
<li>dropbox</li>
<li>mysql</li>
<li>1password</li>
<li>virtualbox</li>
<li>vagrant</li>
<li>chrome</li>
</ul>


<p>With my <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen">fork</a>&hellip;now it&rsquo;s time to start messing around with it. Go ahead and click <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/tree/master/modules/people">here</a> this is for personal manifests. This is something I&rsquo;ll cover in the second half of this post. As I was walking through this, it seems that &ldquo;projects&rdquo; are just a shared collection of manifests also. So if you learn how to make a personal manifest, a project on isn&rsquo;t much more!</p>

<p>Where we want to start is at the default <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/blob/master/manifests/site.pp">site.pp</a> this is what will be installed on all your boxes by well, default.</p>

<p>Ok, first thing first, get a base image running again, open up terminal, and checkout boxen from your fork, (this is my fork and the commands I use from a base install):
<code>
[~] % git --version # click "Install" for the developer tools
[~] % sudo mkdir -p /opt/boxen
[~] % sudo chown ${USER}:staff /opt/boxen
[~] % git clone https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen.git /opt/boxen/repo
[~] % cd /opt/boxen/repo
[/opt/boxen/repo] % git checkout -b removing_nodejs_old_ruby
[/opt/boxen/repo] % cd manifests
[/opt/boxen/repo/manifests] % vim site.pp
</code>
I don&rsquo;t care for nodejs or the older versions of ruby for this example, so I&rsquo;m going to remove lines 66-69 and 72,73 of that site.pp file. If you noticed I created a branch for this too, so I&rsquo;ll push this up to my repo so I can track my work.</p>

<p>Ok, lets give boxen a shot!
<code>
[/opt/boxen/repo/manifests] % cd ..
[/opt/boxen/repo/] % script/boxen --no-fde
[/opt/boxen/repo/] % source /opt/boxen/env.sh
[/opt/boxen/repo/] % boxen
</code>
You&rsquo;ll notice a warning about auto-update, that&rsquo;s fine, you are developing manifests right?</p>

<p>Go ahead and run these commands on the command line, if our changes worked as expected it should say:
<code>bash
jjasghar-Mac:repo jjasghar$ node
-bash: node: command not found
jjasghar-Mac:repo jjasghar$ ruby --version
ruby 2.0.0p247 (2013-06-27 revision 41674) [universal.x86_64-darwin13]
</code>
Hell yes! We got what we expected! Ok, go ahead and commit your changes so you can track your work, and push the branch up if you want to be completely safe.</p>

<h2>Per user manifests</h2>

<p>Ok, go ahead and go to that <code>modules/people</code> and read that <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/tree/master/modules/people">README.md</a> so you get some background.</p>

<p>Now:
<code>bash
[/opt/boxen/repo/] % cd modules/people/manifests
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % git checkout master
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % git checkout -b jjasghar_manifest
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % vim jjasghar.pp # this needs to be your github account name
</code>
Here&rsquo;s a template from <a href="https://github.com/awaxa/our-boxen/blob/master/modules/people/manifests/awaxa.pp">Greg</a>, if you want to see what he&rsquo;s done.
<code>ruby awaxa.pp
class people::awaxa {
  include people::awaxa::applications
  include people::awaxa::dotfiles
  include people::awaxa::gitconfig
  include people::awaxa::preferences
  include people::awaxa::puppetlabs
}
</code>
As you can see he references other files located in that same directory, though in a sub directory as <code>awaxa/</code>. Lets use that <code>include people::awaxa::applications</code> initially.
```ruby applications.pp
class people::awaxa::applications {
  include caffeine
  include chrome
  #include dropbox
  #include gpgtools
  include onepassword
  include java
  include rdio
  include tunnelblick::beta
  include vagrant
  include virtualbox
  include vlc
  include vmware_fusion</p>

<p>  package { [</p>

<pre><code>'htop-osx',
'tmux'
]:
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  package { &lsquo;GoogleVoiceAndVideoSetup&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>source =&gt; 'http://dl.google.com/googletalk/googletalkplugin/GoogleVoiceAndVideoSetup.dmg',
provider =&gt; pkgdmg,
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
<code>
Ok here's the one I created:
</code>ruby jjasghar.pp
class people::jjasghar {
  include people::jjasghar::applications
}
<code>
Nice! Ok, now we need to create:
</code>bash
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % mkdir jjasghar
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % vim jjasghar/applications.pp
```</p>

<p>This is where we add our apps!
<code>ruby applications.pp
class people::jjasghar::applications {
  include iterm2::stable
  include dropbox
  include mysql
  include onepassword
  include virtualbox
  include vagrant
  include chrome
}
</code></p>

<p>Ok, now you need to add these to the <code>Puppetfile</code> located at the root of the boxen repo
```ruby
[&mdash; snip &mdash;]</p>

<h1>Optional/custom modules. There are tons available at</h1>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/boxen.">https://github.com/boxen.</a></h1>

<p>github &ldquo;iterm2&rdquo;, &ldquo;1.0.0&rdquo;, :repo => &ldquo;boxen/puppet-iterm2&rdquo;
github &ldquo;chrome&rdquo;
github &ldquo;dropbox&rdquo;
github &ldquo;mysql&rdquo;
github &ldquo;onepassword&rdquo;
github &ldquo;virtualbox&rdquo;
github &ldquo;vagrant&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>After you update the <code>Puppetfile</code> go ahead and run <code>boxen</code> again:
<code>bash
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % cd /opt/boxen/repo
[/opt/boxen/repo] % boxen
</code></p>

<p>Grats! You got everything installed. This is just the start, but you can see the beauty of this now. Or at least I could.</p>
