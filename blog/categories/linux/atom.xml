    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My goal is to get these few apps on my vm, but first lets get a default build working:</p>

<ul>
<li>iterm2</li>
<li>dropbox</li>
<li>mysql</li>
<li>1password</li>
<li>virtualbox</li>
<li>vagrant</li>
<li>chrome</li>
</ul>


<p>With my <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen">fork</a>&hellip;now it&rsquo;s time to start messing around with it. Go ahead and click <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/tree/master/modules/people">here</a> this is for personal manifests. This is something I&rsquo;ll cover in the second half of this post. As I was walking through this, it seems that &ldquo;projects&rdquo; are just a shared collection of manifests also. So if you learn how to make a personal manifest, a project on isn&rsquo;t much more!</p>

<p>Where we want to start is at the default <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/blob/master/manifests/site.pp">site.pp</a> this is what will be installed on all your boxes by well, default.</p>

<p>Ok, first thing first, get a base image running again, open up terminal, and checkout boxen from your fork, (this is my fork and the commands I use from a base install):
<code>
[~] % git --version # click "Install" for the developer tools
[~] % sudo mkdir -p /opt/boxen
[~] % sudo chown ${USER}:staff /opt/boxen
[~] % git clone https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen.git /opt/boxen/repo
[~] % cd /opt/boxen/repo
[/opt/boxen/repo] % git checkout -b removing_nodejs_old_ruby
[/opt/boxen/repo] % cd manifests
[/opt/boxen/repo/manifests] % vim site.pp
</code>
I don&rsquo;t care for nodejs or the older versions of ruby for this example, so I&rsquo;m going to remove lines 66-69 and 72,73 of that site.pp file. If you noticed I created a branch for this too, so I&rsquo;ll push this up to my repo so I can track my work.</p>

<p>Ok, lets give boxen a shot!
<code>
[/opt/boxen/repo/manifests] % cd ..
[/opt/boxen/repo/] % script/boxen --no-fde
[/opt/boxen/repo/] % source /opt/boxen/env.sh
[/opt/boxen/repo/] % boxen
</code>
You&rsquo;ll notice a warning about auto-update, that&rsquo;s fine, you are developing manifests right?</p>

<p>Go ahead and run these commands on the command line, if our changes worked as expected it should say:
<code>bash
jjasghar-Mac:repo jjasghar$ node
-bash: node: command not found
jjasghar-Mac:repo jjasghar$ ruby --version
ruby 2.0.0p247 (2013-06-27 revision 41674) [universal.x86_64-darwin13]
</code>
Hell yes! We got what we expected! Ok, go ahead and commit your changes so you can track your work, and push the branch up if you want to be completely safe.</p>

<h2>Per user manifests</h2>

<p>Ok, go ahead and go to that <code>modules/people</code> and read that <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/our-boxen/tree/master/modules/people">README.md</a> so you get some background.</p>

<p>Now:
<code>bash
[/opt/boxen/repo/] % cd modules/people/manifests
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % git checkout master
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % git checkout -b jjasghar_manifest
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % vim jjasghar.pp # this needs to be your github account name
</code>
Here&rsquo;s a template from <a href="https://github.com/awaxa/our-boxen/blob/master/modules/people/manifests/awaxa.pp">Greg</a>, if you want to see what he&rsquo;s done.
<code>[ruby] [awaxa.pp]
class people::awaxa {
  include people::awaxa::applications
  include people::awaxa::dotfiles
  include people::awaxa::gitconfig
  include people::awaxa::preferences
  include people::awaxa::puppetlabs
}
</code>
As you can see he references other files located in that same directory, though in a sub directory as <code>awaxa/</code>. Lets use that <code>include people::awaxa::applications</code> initially.
```[ruby] [applications.pp]
class people::awaxa::applications {
  include caffeine
  include chrome
  #include dropbox
  #include gpgtools
  include onepassword
  include java
  include rdio
  include tunnelblick::beta
  include vagrant
  include virtualbox
  include vlc
  include vmware_fusion</p>

<p>  package { [</p>

<pre><code>'htop-osx',
'tmux'
]:
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  package { &lsquo;GoogleVoiceAndVideoSetup&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>source =&gt; 'http://dl.google.com/googletalk/googletalkplugin/GoogleVoiceAndVideoSetup.dmg',
provider =&gt; pkgdmg,
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
<code>
Ok here's the one I created:
</code>[ruby] [jjasghar.pp]
class people::jjasghar {
  include people::jjasghar::applications
}
<code>
Nice! Ok, now we need to create:
</code>bash
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % mkdir jjasghar
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % vim jjasghar/applications.pp
```</p>

<p>This is where we add our apps!
<code>[ruby] [applications.pp]
class people::jjasghar::applications {
  include iterm2::stable
  include dropbox
  include mysql
  include onepassword
  include virtualbox
  include vagrant
  include chrome
}
</code></p>

<p>Ok, now you need to add these to the <code>Puppetfile</code> located at the root of the boxen repo
```ruby
[&mdash; snip &mdash;]</p>

<h1>Optional/custom modules. There are tons available at</h1>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/boxen.">https://github.com/boxen.</a></h1>

<p>github &ldquo;iterm2&rdquo;, &ldquo;1.0.0&rdquo;, :repo => &ldquo;boxen/puppet-iterm2&rdquo;
github &ldquo;chrome&rdquo;
github &ldquo;dropbox&rdquo;
github &ldquo;mysql&rdquo;
github &ldquo;onepassword&rdquo;
github &ldquo;virtualbox&rdquo;
github &ldquo;vagrant&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>After you update the <code>Puppetfile</code> go ahead and run <code>boxen</code> again:
<code>bash
[/opt/boxen/repo/modules/people/manifests] % cd /opt/boxen/repo
[/opt/boxen/repo] % boxen
</code></p>

<p>Grats! You got everything installed. This is just the start, but you can see the beauty of this now. Or at least I could.</p>

    <link href="http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/12/31/adventures-with-boxen/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-31T15:54:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/12/31/adventures-with-boxen</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Note: Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/awaxa/">Greg Kitson</a> as my sounding board and inspiration here to get this done.</p>

<p>So I started watching a couple videos on <a href="http://boxen.github.com">boxen</a> both are done by <a href="https://twitter.com/wfarr">@wfarr</a> and he&rsquo;s convinced me to give it a shot. Here is the &ldquo;first&rdquo; part of me getting up a dev env to play around with it.</p>

<p>I think the thing that got me was the &ldquo;one line cURL&rdquo; that you can run which is from <a href="https://github.com/boxen/boxen-web">boxen-web</a> so that&rsquo;s my ultimate goal here; ok lets start this off.</p>

<p>First thing, read the <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> and something jumps out at me straight off the bat:
<code>
Boxen requires at least the Xcode Command Line Tools installed.
Boxen will not work with an existing rvm install.
Boxen may not play nice with a GitHub username that includes dash(-)
Boxen may not play nice with an existing rbenv install.
Boxen may not play nice with an existing chruby install.
Boxen may not play nice with an existing homebrew install.
Boxen may not play nice with an existing nvm install.
Boxen recommends installing the full Xcode.
</code>
<em>sigh</em> So this means I need a vm to start playing with this. I chose virtualbox as my hypervisor. The trick is; you can only virtualize OS X on OS X so get it installed on your mac ;).</p>

<p>It seems there is a Mavericks network issue with <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=58036">virtualbox 4.2</a> so I suggest updating to the latest before going any farther. I ran into a problem with the network adapter and the install wizard wouldn&rsquo;t get farther than Manual/DHCP network setup. <em>grrr</em></p>

<p>Ok, so I&rsquo;m writing this real time&hellip;yeah this blew up. So I converted to <a href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_fusion/6_0">VMware Fusion 6</a> to attempt to build the box. Lets see how that goes.</p>

<p>So tricky VMware Fusion, it says it&rsquo;s designed for Windows, but you can use the Install.App you got from the Mac App store. When it asks for an image to install from, just point it there!</p>

<p>Spin up a machine like it suggests and get a base image installed. Go ahead shut it down here, take a snapshot it as &ldquo;base install or something&rdquo; so you can roll back here because you&rsquo;re using a provisioning software and you need a clean box right? RIGHT? (yes yes vagrant would be perfect here, but that&rsquo;s another cost got get it working with fusion)</p>

<p>After you got that done boot up the vm open terminal run the following:</p>

<p><code>git --version</code></p>

<p>This should prompt you to install the &ldquo;mac cli tools&rdquo; without needing to install Xcode. Badass.</p>

<p>Go ahead and fork <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">our-boxen</a> like it suggests. Now if you want this to be private, for your company..(I&rsquo;m not doing because I&rsquo;m trying to learn this), you have to go through the following:
<code>bash
[~] % sudo mkdir -p /opt/boxen
[~] % sudo chown ${USER}:staff /opt/boxen
[~] % git clone https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen /opt/boxen/repo
[~] % cd /opt/boxen/repo
[/opt/boxen/repo] % git remote rm origin
[/opt/boxen/repo] % git remote add origin &lt;the location of my new git repository&gt;
[/opt/boxen/repo] % git push -u origin master
</code>
This deploys the default boxen setup like the README.md says, customizing is in a following post.</p>

<p>Ok, now try out boxen:
<code>bash
[/opt/boxen/repo] % ./script/boxen
</code>
Alas this will probably bitch about no Full Disk Encryption, so you&rsquo;ll need to run (good for developing this):
<code>bash
[/opt/boxen/repo] % ./script/boxen --no-fde
</code></p>

<p>It should ask you for your github credentials (yes it works with two factor authentication), then you should start seeing a bunch of stuff on the screen!</p>

<p>NOTE: you might see it get stuck at <code>Dnsmasq</code> for a default run. If you check activity monitor it is running and talking to Greg, it seems that&rsquo;s gcc/make compiling something in the background. This might take a long time, wait it out.</p>

<p>Grats you have successfully started up boxen and got it running. Now lets customize it, that should be the following post&hellip;</p>

    <link href="http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/12/23/running-knife-openstack-on-a-private-rackspace-instance/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-23T10:36:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/12/23/running-knife-openstack-on-a-private-rackspace-instance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So congrats you got your new &ldquo;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/">Private Cloud</a>&rdquo; from Rackspace. You are probably ecstatic to start building your new machines.
I know I was; but alas with all new toys sometimes you hit a couple stags. Here are a couple things I ran into on my first few days.</p>

<h3>First issue</h3>

<p>So I&rsquo;m a chef shop, as you might know by now (assuming you&rsquo;ve read any of my other posts). I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace">knife-rackspace</a> tons of times; and hell I even have a <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace/commits?author=jjasghar">commit bit</a>. So logically I thought I could leverage this same gem with different backend api points. Nope, I was hard core wrong.
You end up having to install <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-openstack">knife-openstack</a>. That in itself isn&rsquo;t bad at all&hellip;
<code>bash
[~] % gem install knife-openstack
</code>
Now you need to update your <code>knife.rb</code>
<code>bash
[~] % vim ~/.chef/knife.rb
</code>
In your handoff ticket, you probably got something that looks like this:
<code>bash
export OS_USERNAME=Im_awesome_admin
export OS_PASSWORD=$omeCr@zyA$$passwD
export OS_TENANT_NAME=MyCompanyName
export OS_AUTH_URL=http://10.219.0.254:5000/v2.0/
export OS_AUTH_STRATEGY=keystone:
</code>
Go ahead and copy them out to what they need to be, something like&hellip;
```ruby
knife[:openstack_username] = &ldquo;Your OpenStack Dashboard username&rdquo;
knife[:openstack_password] = &ldquo;Your OpenStack Dashboard password&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Note: If you are not proxying HTTPS to the OpenStack auth port, the scheme should be HTTP</h3>

<p>knife[:openstack_auth_url] = &ldquo;<a href="http://cloud.mycompany.com:5000/v2.0/tokens">http://cloud.mycompany.com:5000/v2.0/tokens</a>&rdquo;
knife[:openstack_tenant] = &ldquo;Your OpenStack tenant name&rdquo;
knife[:openstack_ssh_key_id] = &ldquo;my sshkey id&rdquo;
<code>
Great! So run that great command `knife openstack flavor list` to see if everything works....
</code>bash
[~] % knife openstack server list
ERROR: knife encountered an unexpected error
This may be a bug in the &lsquo;openstack server list&rsquo; knife command or plugin
Please collect the output of this command with the <code>-VV</code> option before filing a bug report.
Exception: NoMethodError: undefined method `[]&lsquo; for nil:NilClass
```
Crap..</p>

<p>Ok, lets try out with <code>-VV</code></p>

<p><code>``ruby
DEBUG: openstack_username Im_awsome_admin
DEBUG: openstack_auth_url http://10.219.0.254:5000/v2.0/

<pre><code>from /Users/jasghar/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p195/gems/knife-openstack-0.8.1/lib/chef/knife/openstack_flavor_list.rb:41:in `run'

from /Users/jasghar/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p195/bin/ruby_executable_hooks:15:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s not a lot of help eh? Turns out, if you look at the ticket that Rackspace gives you and what the <code>[:openstack_auth_url]</code> requires you&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s a <code>/tokens</code> at the end. Do'h!</p>

<h3>Second issue</h3>

<p>Ok, so you got the ability to talk to your backend? Yay! But alas, you run your create&hellip;
```bash
[~] % knife openstack server create -S jj-mba-key -I 349168d3-5381-4324-8636-398d012f852b -f 1 -N testbox
Instance Name: testbox
Instance ID: 5e0ec79c-e06a-4fdb-9887-2b30ae1e5f80</p>

<p>Waiting for server&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
Flavor: 1
Image: 349168d3-5381-4324-8636-398d012f852b
SSH Keypair: jj-mba-key
ERROR: No IP address available for bootstrapping.
```
What the hell does that mean? Well I&rsquo;m not going to explain it all but it seems that by default Rackspace names the &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo; networks as &ldquo;Fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Floating.&rdquo;
This is triggered a fog issue, where it&rsquo;s looking at the label for a network either &ldquo;public&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; and blows up. There is a ticket in for this <a href="https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE-231">here</a> but it looks like it&rsquo;s stalled from late summer, early fall. Lammmeeee.</p>

<p>So you are probably saying &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just rename them?&rdquo; Good for you, great idea&hellip;but no, Openstack doesn&rsquo;t support that. So at this time, it looks like you&rsquo;ll have to delete them and rebuild them with the &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo; names. Hopefully you&rsquo;ve noticed this at just the begining of building out your machines, otherwise you&rsquo;ll have to nuke and pave everything you&rsquo;ve done to get the new networks in.</p>

<p>Ah!, almost forgot. Before you go I should mention a quick note, notice the lowercase p in both public and private. Yes, it&rsquo;s THAT picky&hellip;</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/11/27/hubot-plus-herkou-and-how-i-spent-much-more-time-than-i-thought-i-should</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I recently watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps</a> and got sold on <a href="http://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>.  We had him at my company for a while, but
with a migration we lost him; so I took it upon myself to learn how to use him again.  All in all getting him running inside my company was pretty straight forward, hell even getting
node to work on my local box for local development (<a href="https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814">this gist</a> sums it up nicely) wasn&rsquo;t hard at all.  I found myself wanting my own hubot for <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/meme_captain.coffee">memes</a> generation, or just to play around with.</p>

<p>So I decided hell, lets try out the <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md">heroku</a> install. It was pretty straight forward, I got my repo running, got it deployed; but I ran into an error:
<code>
ERROR Campfire request error: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND
</code>
This is what the doc says&hellip;.
<code>
% heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=yourcampfireaccount
% heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN=yourcampfiretoken
</code>
I put my <code>HUBOT_CAMPEFIRE_ACCOUNT</code> name as my hubot&rsquo;s account name with the token which seems logical&hellip;wth man?
<code>
HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=hubotsemail@myaccountname.com
</code>
I did some searching, googling, (it seems a few people had this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ERROR+Campfire+request+error%3A+Error%3A+getaddrinfo+ENOTFOUND&amp;oq=ERROR+Campfire+request+error%3A+Error%3A+getaddrinfo+ENOTFOUND&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.2689j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">issue</a>, but no fixes were posted), more reading, and it something clicked with me, maybe it&rsquo;s the actual consumer account that it connects to, not the hubot account? So I tried this:
<code>
HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=myaccountname.campfirenow.com
</code>
Damn, nope.
<code>
ERROR Campfire request error: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND
</code>
I figured I&rsquo;d try with <code>https://</code>&hellip;..
<code>
HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=https://myaccountname.campfirenow.com
</code>
Damnit.
<code>
ERROR Campfire request error: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND
</code>
Finally I started searching around actual hubot <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/issues/329">issues</a> and came across that guy. The <code>HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT</code> just needed to be the subdomain. Do'h!
<code>
HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=myaccountname
</code>
Boom, it worked.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-16T11:11:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/10/16/checking-cpu-wait-via-nagios</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So our machines swap&hellip;.swap alot. There are the  typical nagios system checks, you can have the <code>check_swap</code> call, but at my company the &lt; 20 % hits so often we needed to figure out a way to get warned about crippling proformance. We discovered that when a machine has CPU WAIT spikes, the proformance for the machine tanks, so I tried to find a check for specificly monitor the CPU WAIT.  I should mention also that most/all of the boxes we run are VMs, and waiting on IO for swap makes a sad sysadmin.</p>

<p>I took a stab at creating a check myself and the following is a simple nagios check that you can run via NRPE.  The <code>PERCENTAGE</code> line is changeable, I&rsquo;d make sure your alarm reflects your error cases. We choose 10 % because that&rsquo;s when we started seeing real prefomance issues, but as all sysadmins know any CPU WAIT is bad in general.</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>stateid=
CPUWAIT=<code>top -b -n 1| grep 'wa,' | awk -F ',' {'print $5'} | cut -d . -f 1 | tr -d ' '</code>
PERCENTAGE=10</p>

<p>if [ ${CPUWAIT} -le ${PERCENTAGE} ]
 then
   echo Your CPU WAIT is under ${PERCENTAGE}%
   stateid=0
elif [ ${CPUWAIT} -ge ${PERCENTAGE} ]
 then
   echo Your CPU WAIT is at ${CPUWAIT}%, your machine aint happy
   stateid=2
 fi
exit $stateid
```</p>

<p>You are probably wondering &ldquo;There are alot of great systems checks on <a href="http://exchange.nagios.org/">Nagios Exchange</a>,&rdquo; but the site is so hard to use and useally much more than I need, like in this case.</p>
