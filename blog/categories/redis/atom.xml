    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like most sysadmins out there, I read the blogs and posts about new technologies that are relevant to my product(s).  There has been a lot of buzz about NoSQL and the key value store type db&rsquo;s out there, yet I have never really focused directly on it.  I have paid passing attention, until I realized that we use one heavily at my company.</p>

<p><a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> is a key value store that runs completely in memory. It&rsquo;s fast, REALLY fast, and after spending some time with a few tutorials like <a href="http://openmymind.net/2012/1/23/The-Little-Redis-Book/">The Little Redis Book</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/karlseguin">Karl Seguin</a>, it makes a ton of sense, and an extremely neat backend piece of software.</p>

<p>I started to learn more about it, and I started talking to a coworker and he said that he really wanted to upgrade from 2.4 redis to 2.6 redis. I took this as a challenge, and ran with it.</p>

<p>The first part of the migration is creating a slave.  We had .aof and .rdb snapshotting, but we didn&rsquo;t have a slave. This post is be going to be chronicling my adventures getting from 2.4.16 to 2.6.16.</p>

<p>Another coworker of mine, <a href="https://github.com/lwoodson">Lance Woodson</a>, created a script called &ldquo;<a href="https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/423d040444a4f4cbea1d">bloater</a>&rdquo; to start putting trash keys in the redis db.  As you can see it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward, I do strongly suggest using <code>bloater.clear!</code> if you are playing with it.  I leveraged this to simulate creating a slave already in production, the theory being I&rsquo;ll have data inside the redis db, things talking to db, and the sync happening.  I understand that a lot of people have tested this situation, but I couldn&rsquo;t seem to find any direct examples.  Hopefully this will be useful to someone.</p>

<p>The first step after getting my 2.4.16 redis machine running, I ran <code>bloater.bloat! 2295000000</code> to get an .rdb file that was ~2 gigs.  I configured the snapshotting at the default values so it created it without a hitch.  I copied it off called it something like <code>2gig-dump.rdb</code> or something.  Then I ran <code>bloater.bloat! 4295000000</code> to create the 4gig dump file.  I copied that off next and then I had my two dumpfiles that I could play with.  You are probably wondering why 2 and 4 gigs, and also &ldquo;Dang, that&rsquo;s a huge redis db.&rdquo; Yes, yes it is, I focused on the &ldquo;oh crap, our db is too big&rdquo; situation, so if redis handles that, then I know it&rsquo;ll deal with the 100 meg db just fine.</p>

<p>Secondly I did my <code>FLUSHALL</code> command, then shutdown my redis instance then copied the 2 gig db, in the <code>/var/lib/redis/</code> location.  I spun up redis, and ran the <code>INFO</code> command, like all redis admins learn to love to do.  I saw that it was 2 gigs, and yay, now I had my foundation to start my testing.</p>

<p>I went through quite a few different iterations, but I&rsquo;ll just explain the basic trouble shooting that I did, and maybe you can leverage off it.</p>

<p>So with my redis 2.4 instance with a 2 gig db, and my 2.6 blank db instance it was time to start the fun.  I ran the following commands in a tmux session on my main workstation.  I liked the idea of a 3rd party machine actually looking at all this stuff instead of running directly on one of the machines.
<code>bash
watch "redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep master_sync_left_bytes "
redis-cli -h redis-slave keys "*" | wc -l
redis-cli -h redis-master keys "*" | wc -l
redis-cli -h redis-master info | grep used_memory
redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep used_memory
redis-cli -h redis-master --latency
</code></p>

<p>Most, if not all are pretty self explanatory.  The most interesting one of them all is probably the last one, the <code>--latency</code>.  It used it as a way to emulate something poking my redis instance during the inital clone. The thing we, [where|are|still] worried about is customer impact, and as long as the number didn&rsquo;t sky rocket then stay high it was an acceptable risk.</p>

<p>After I got the tmux session all up and happy, i  ran these two commands to start the <code>slaveof</code>:
```bash</p>

<h1>on the master</h1>

<p>redis-master:6379> slaveof no one</p>

<h1>on the slave</h1>

<p>redis-slave:6379> slaveof redis-master 6379
```</p>

<p>It worked like a charm. The <pre>watch &ldquo;redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep master_sync_left_bytes &rdquo;</pre> started giving me data, and before I knew it I had a working master slave configuration.  This was a lot of cruft to basically say <code>slaveof redis-master 6379</code> but hell it&rsquo;s sometimes nice to see the thought process around it.  Oh!, the latency, did spike to 800 from .05, but I discovered that was in milliseconds and only ONE sample.  So yeah one call to the master with a spike of something still sub-second, was still in the risk params.
Now I have a working master slave configuration.  Next (part 2) I&rsquo;ll post about my monitoring of this, it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> exciting, but it is useful.</p>
