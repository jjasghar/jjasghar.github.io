    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I&rsquo;ve been caught up in the <a href="http://docker.io">docker</a>, <a href="http://packer.io">packer</a>, and VM discussion a handful of times. I&rsquo;ve been defending and discussing<em>cough</em>attacking<em>cough</em> different
versions and use cases. Then something happened, something I thought docker is wasn&rsquo;t what it was, and something I thought packer was isn&rsquo;t what it is. Welp, there&rsquo;s some egg on my face eh?
So here&rsquo;s a cheatsheet type post about the difference and <strong>POSSIBLE</strong> use cases.</p>

<h3>docker</h3>

<p>As the docker says in their <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dotCloud/docker-intro-november">intro slide deck</a>, it&rsquo;s designed to &ldquo;ship code.&rdquo; This is important distinction between this and what a VM does.
docker is a souped–up version of <a href="http://linuxcontainers.org/">lxc</a> or to a lesser extent <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/jails.html">freebsd jails</a>. It allows you to
run an application in it&rsquo;s own little bubble, but has a <em>shared</em> underlying OS/kernel. (in this case linux) It allows for a quick provisioning of an application disposable and transient applications
which is great for development work. You can spin up a &ldquo;base&rdquo; build extremely quickly and hack away and it and rollback to a know good spot, without having to reimage/build the machine. In the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>
world this is great for iterations. I guess a good simile is like you have a pad of paper with a base story printed on each page, you tack on the writing you want at the bottom, and if you don&rsquo;t like it just tear it
away and start again.</p>

<h3>VM</h3>

<p>So docker is designed for an application? Isn&rsquo;t that what a VM is designed for? Not exactly. docker shares the kernel and base os, while a VM is it&rsquo;s own entity. VMs also require a hypervisor of some type
that sits on another os; so if you can imagine it, VM = os ontop of hypervisor (that controls the VMs) on top of another os. This has it&rsquo;s merits, but at the same time it can be cumbersome, for development. It seems
VMs use case, compared to something like docker, is more for production deployments, more static content that updates through a deployment system.  This can bring in security uses and the like, keep that in mind.</p>

<h3>packer</h3>

<p>packer in a couple words is this: a way to create base or gold VM images. It&rsquo;s designed to create a typical/transferable VM image that works with multiple platforms and hypervisors. An example, you have a beloved mail server, you create
an image of this box, but you&rsquo;re boss now says you&rsquo;re moving cloud providers and  have to get it working on <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">digital ocean</a>. packer makes that conversion &ldquo;simple,&rdquo; which packs up the image to be portable and transferable.
I say simple mainly because honestly I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, but I have watched a few youtube tutorials on it.</p>

<p>This post is spurred from my miss understanding of the scope of docker and VMs, and in the process of groking them, rediscovering packer.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell: docker is a wrapper for lxc/jails for linux running an app sharing a common kernel, VMs are separate entities and kernels that more production focused, and packer is a way to create transferable VMs between hypervisors.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/02/07/chef-handler-why-did-it-take-a-year-for-me-to-use-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Something that I never seemed to grok was <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_handlers.html">chef handlers</a>. I read that site like 50 times, got the jist, but never fully understood them.</p>

<p>Then I learned it in a nutshell: you know when you run <code>chef-client</code> or <code>chef-solo</code> and that error that pops up? A handler can export it to another location so you can have a centralized stream of information.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t just limited to error reporting, you can report a bunch of stuff, but errors are something that admins should visualize ASAP.</p>

<p>This is AMAZINGLY useful if you have more than a couple nodes. Lets say you have 100-200ish nodes (like me) and you decided that you wanted to run <code>knife ssh 'chef_environment:staging' 'sudo chef-client'</code>.</p>

<p>Awesome, so it kicks off, you have a few changes but you had a typo in your <code>role[db_slave]</code>. Well, if you&rsquo;ve ever used <code>knife ssh</code> before you&rsquo;ll know that it streams everything real-time
and you&rsquo;ll probably miss the nasty red text that says you have an error. If you have your handler; it takes it says &ldquo;Hey error here, lets push it up to [email|campfire|growl|hipchat|etc]&rdquo; and boom everyone knows that
there&rsquo;s a problem with the converge. If you are lucky enough to have a regular checkin with the chef-server you&rsquo;ll get the error pop up each run till you have it fixed. Annoying yes, but it makes sure you have all you machines
in a good state.</p>

<p>If this has peaked your interest, there is a cookbook called <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef_handler">chef_handler</a> that does most if not all of your heavy lifting. It leverages an LWRP that needs to be close if not the first in your <code>run_list</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example for <a href="https://github.com/kisoku/chef-handler-mail">chef-handler-mail</a>:</p>

<p>```ruby
chef_gem &ldquo;chef-handler-mail&rdquo;
gem &ldquo;chef-handler-mail&rdquo;</p>

<p>chef_handler &ldquo;MailHandler&rdquo; do
   source &lsquo;chef/handler/mail&rsquo;
   arguments :to_address => &ldquo;root&rdquo;
   action :nothing
end.run_action(:enable)
```
As you can see it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>My company uses <a href="http://campfirenow.com/">campfire</a> and there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/ampledata/chef-handler-campfire">chef-handler-campfire</a> gem for it. The LWRP stanza that you put in your recipe requires something to this effect, I put this in the
first main internal recipe:</p>

<p>```ruby
include_recipe &lsquo;chef_handler&rsquo;</p>

<p>chef_gem &ldquo;chef-handler-campfire&rdquo; do
  action :install
end</p>

<p>chef_handler &lsquo;Chef::Handler::Campfire&rsquo; do
  action :enable
  arguments [ &lsquo;SUBDOMAIN&rsquo;, &lsquo;TOKEN&rsquo; , &lsquo;ROOM&rsquo; ]
  source File.join(Gem.all_load_paths.grep(/chef-handler-campfire/).first,</p>

<pre><code>               'chef', 'handler', 'campfire.rb')
</code></pre>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>Note: Unfortunately the newest <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/tinder">tinder</a> requires <code>json ~&gt; '1.8.0'</code> and chef <code>11.8.2</code> requires <code>json ~&gt; '1.7.7'</code>.  Last night (2014-02-06) chef <a href="http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/02/06/chef-client-11-10-0-release/">released 11.10</a> which fixes this, the embedded chef binary now uses 1.8.0. I have a <a href="https://github.com/ampledata/chef-handler-campfire/pull/2">PR</a> to fix up the README.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to handlers, but for now this is huge win for me, I&rsquo;ll post more as I start learning the reporting side of it.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/02/03/resourcenotfound-and-splunk>-fun-dot-dot-dot-gotta-love-that-error</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My company uses <a href="http://splunk.com">splunk</a> yes yes, I know, I should be using <a href="https://github.com/rashidkpc/Kibana">kibana</a> and <a href="http://logstash.net/">logstash</a> but I got the budget for splunk> so I&rsquo;m using splunk.</p>

<p>I attempted to install an updated license the other day and got an interesting error after restarting splunk and attempting to log in:
```
500 Internal Server Error</p>

<p>Return to Splunk home page</p>

<p>ResourceNotFound: [HTTP 404] <a href="https://127.0.0.1:8089/services/data/user-prefs;">https://127.0.0.1:8089/services/data/user-prefs;</a> [{&lsquo;type&rsquo;: &lsquo;ERROR&rsquo;, &lsquo;text&rsquo;: &lsquo;Application does not exist: user-prefs&rsquo;, &lsquo;code&rsquo;: None}]</p>

<p>This page was linked to from <a href="http://">http://</a><mycompanyname>:8000/en-US/account/login?return_to=%2Fen-US%2F.</p>

<p>You are using <mycompanyname>:8000, which is connected to splunkd @182037 at <a href="https://127.0.0.1:8089">https://127.0.0.1:8089</a> on Mon Feb 3 16:17:37 2014.
```</p>

<p>Wow, what the hell does that mean?</p>

<p>So after some investigation it seems that I had my <code>/opt/splunk/bin/splunk</code> symlinked to <code>/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk</code>. After some finagling with splunk support it seems it was a complete
oversight.</p>

<p>Having both the <code>splunkforwarder</code> and <code>splunk</code> on the same box can be dangerous, if you do you&rsquo;ll have to edit the ports that they use. Keep that in mind if you decide to go down this path.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/01/25/boxen-is-neat-but-man-chef-solo-was-so-much-easier</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So over the 2013 holiday break I played around with <a href="http://boxen.github.com/">boxen</a>, I even wrote a couple beginner posts on it. If you want go check them out, I&rsquo;ll wait&hellip;..</p>

<p>So, yeah, you can tell I was pretty impressed with it right?</p>

<p>Well from a guy that uses <a href="http://getchef.com">chef</a> day in and day out, using it in a real life scenario it was a nightmare.</p>

<p>First off, I can understand some of the choices they made; like putting everything in <code>/opt/boxen</code>. Alas the disadvantage is that well EVERYTHING is in <code>/opt/boxen</code>. My company leverages <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> for all our base development software, and it seems that boxen installs the binary at <code>/opt/boxen/homebrew</code>. This in turn confuses the hell out of the seasoned admin AND the new person developer trying just do a simple <code>brew install &lt;someapp&gt;</code>. No joke, I spent 2-3 hours trying to figure out why boxen said homebrew was installed but I couldn&rsquo;t simplify just use <code>brew</code>. I ended up symlinking like crazy not realizing that I hand to <code>source /opt/boxen/script/env.sh</code>.  Turns out it seems I completely missed that small note in the docs/wrapper script, saying you need to source it. <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>Along with that nasty turn, one of the selling points was my ability to <code>git clone</code> down my companies code from Github. Yeah that didn&rsquo;t work at all. I forgot how hard it was to make a damn directory with puppet, then to use the <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-repository">puppet-repository</a> and have it fall on it&rsquo;s face only frustrated me even farther. Strike two boxen, strike two.</p>

<p>The final strike came pretty simply but I didn&rsquo;t realize how much of a pain it was. The <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-mysql">puppet-mysql</a> runs it&rsquo;s socket file in both a completely different location and runs a completely nonstandard port to connect to it. Now to a sysadmin like myself, this seems negligible, neigh, not even negligible,  but put this in front of a Developer that has to change his <code>database.yml</code> and all hell breaks loose.   And to top that off, because the database.yml is part of the code base, if said Dev decides to push it back upstream it opens up a can of worms asking why we have to have something like the following for everyone:
```ruby
&lt;%
  socket = [</p>

<pre><code>ENV["BOXEN_MYSQL_SOCKET"],
"/var/run/mysql5/mysqld.sock",
"/tmp/mysql.sock"
</code></pre>

<p>  ].detect { |f| f &amp;&amp; File.exist?(f) }</p>

<p>  port = ENV[&ldquo;BOXEN_MYSQL_PORT&rdquo;] || &ldquo;3306&rdquo;
%></p>

<p>development: &amp;development
  adapter: mysql
  database: yourapp_development
  username: root
&lt;% if socket %>
  host: localhost
  socket: &lt;%= socket %>
&lt;% else %>
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: &lt;%= port %>
&lt;% end %></p>

<h1>Warning: The database defined as &ldquo;test&rdquo; will be erased and</h1>

<h1>re-generated from your development database when you run &ldquo;rake&rdquo;.</h1>

<h1>Do not set this db to the same as development or production.</h1>

<p>test:
  &lt;&lt;: *development
  database: yourapp_test
```</p>

<p>Yeah that ain&rsquo;t worth it AT ALL.  Now that I&rsquo;ve got my bitching out of the way, on to the happiness that is chef.</p>

<p>I took what I learned from boxen, and took the plunge into chef-solo to fix this issue. I recalled attempting to use chef-solo on OSX when I first started and it was also complete disaster. I&rsquo;m betting I really had no idea what I was doing so that&rsquo;s probably a major factor in it. But now I feel have mastered it on &ldquo;the linuxes&rdquo;, and hell even wrote a sensu cookbook for windows, so I told myself to take the plunge.  Man, I&rsquo;m really glad I did; TL;DR: easy pezzy.</p>

<p>I started around noon after deciding that boxen was dead, and by 3pm I had a working framework with a <a href="http://bit.ly/jj_mac">wrapper script</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/homebrew">homebrew</a>, and <a href="http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/08/02/adventures-with-chef-solo/">chef-solo</a>, why oh why didn&rsquo;t I do this originally.</p>

<p>(I pinged Fletcher Nichol about getting test-kitchen working with OSX, he sent me a gist on how to get it working, as of writing this I haven&rsquo;t attempted it yet, but hellz yes I&rsquo;m gonna kitchen this bitch up very very soon.)</p>

<p>I had some trouble with <a href="http://rvm.io">rvm</a>, automating the install was a bit tricky, but breaking it up into different <code>execute</code> and <code>bash</code> blocks allowed for solidarity. After that hooking up the <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/dmg">dmg</a> cookbook and boom, I have my <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/provision_mac">mac provisioning</a> system.</p>

<p>Take a look, I&rsquo;m honestly curious on what people think. Oh, take out the <code>repo.rb</code> though, it&rsquo;s specific to my company.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-20T15:42:33-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2014/01/20/a-chef-error-that-has-haunted-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, you may have seen this before:
<code>ruby
23.987.33.854   * cookbook_file[/etc/init.d/apache2] action create
23.987.33.854 ================================================================================
23.987.33.854 Error executing action `create` on resource 'cookbook_file[/etc/init.d/apache2]'
23.987.33.854 ================================================================================
23.987.33.854
23.987.33.854
23.987.33.854 Net::HTTPServerException

23.987.33.854 403 "Forbidden"
23.987.33.854
23.987.33.854
</code></p>

<p>NOTE: Yes, that is a fake ip, and yes that server Exception isn&rsquo;t tied just to apache2.</p>

<p>If you have, you know my pain.  Turns out there is a <a href="https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4253">ticket</a> on this and also a couple <a href="http://sanketdangi.com/post/50897416859/chef-errors-and-their-solutions">blog posts</a> also.</p>

<p>The gist of this:</p>

<blockquote><p>This error is encountered when we have large chef recipes whose deployment time on clients is large than 15 minutes. In order to avoid this error, please increase “s3_url_ttl" value from 900 seconds to required time interval</p></blockquote>

<p>So the fix is:
```bash
[~] % sudo vim /etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb</p>

<h1>add this line: erchef[‘s3_url_ttl’] = 900 where 900 is something larger&hellip;maybe 1800?</h1>

<p>[~] % sudo chef-server-ctl reconfigure
```</p>

<p>Boom, you should be good now. No more damn 403s.</p>
