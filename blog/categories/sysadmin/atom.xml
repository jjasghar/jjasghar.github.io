    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like most sysadmins out there, I read the blogs and posts about new technologies that are relevant to my product(s).  There has been a lot of buzz about NoSQL and the key value store type db&rsquo;s out there, yet I have never really focused directly on it.  I have paid passing attention, until I realized that we use one heavily at my company.</p>

<p><a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> is a key value store that runs completely in memory. It&rsquo;s fast, REALLY fast, and after spending some time with a few tutorials like <a href="http://openmymind.net/2012/1/23/The-Little-Redis-Book/">The Little Redis Book</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/karlseguin">Karl Seguin</a>, it makes a ton of sense, and an extremely neat backend piece of software.</p>

<p>I started to learn more about it, and I started talking to a coworker and he said that he really wanted to upgrade from 2.4 redis to 2.6 redis. I took this as a challenge, and ran with it.</p>

<p>The first part of the migration is creating a slave.  We had .aof and .rdb snapshotting, but we didn&rsquo;t have a slave. This post is be going to be chronicling my adventures getting from 2.4.16 to 2.6.16.</p>

<p>Another coworker of mine, <a href="https://github.com/lwoodson">Lance Woodson</a>, created a script called &ldquo;<a href="https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/423d040444a4f4cbea1d">bloater</a>&rdquo; to start putting trash keys in the redis db.  As you can see it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward, I do strongly suggest using <code>bloater.clear!</code> if you are playing with it.  I leveraged this to simulate creating a slave already in production, the theory being I&rsquo;ll have data inside the redis db, things talking to db, and the sync happening.  I understand that a lot of people have tested this situation, but I couldn&rsquo;t seem to find any direct examples.  Hopefully this will be useful to someone.</p>

<p>The first step after getting my 2.4.16 redis machine running, I ran <code>bloater.bloat! 2295000000</code> to get an .rdb file that was ~2 gigs.  I configured the snapshotting at the default values so it created it without a hitch.  I copied it off called it something like <code>2gig-dump.rdb</code> or something.  Then I ran <code>bloater.bloat! 4295000000</code> to create the 4gig dump file.  I copied that off next and then I had my two dumpfiles that I could play with.  You are probably wondering why 2 and 4 gigs, and also &ldquo;Dang, that&rsquo;s a huge redis db.&rdquo; Yes, yes it is, I focused on the &ldquo;oh crap, our db is too big&rdquo; situation, so if redis handles that, then I know it&rsquo;ll deal with the 100 meg db just fine.</p>

<p>Secondly I did my <code>FLUSHALL</code> command, then shutdown my redis instance then copied the 2 gig db, in the <code>/var/lib/redis/</code> location.  I spun up redis, and ran the <code>INFO</code> command, like all redis admins learn to love to do.  I saw that it was 2 gigs, and yay, now I had my foundation to start my testing.</p>

<p>I went through quite a few different iterations, but I&rsquo;ll just explain the basic trouble shooting that I did, and maybe you can leverage off it.</p>

<p>So with my redis 2.4 instance with a 2 gig db, and my 2.6 blank db instance it was time to start the fun.  I ran the following commands in a tmux session on my main workstation.  I liked the idea of a 3rd party machine actually looking at all this stuff instead of running directly on one of the machines.
<code>bash
watch "redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep master_sync_left_bytes "
redis-cli -h redis-slave keys "*" | wc -l
redis-cli -h redis-master keys "*" | wc -l
redis-cli -h redis-master info | grep used_memory
redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep used_memory
redis-cli -h redis-master --latency
</code></p>

<p>Most, if not all are pretty self explanatory.  The most interesting one of them all is probably the last one, the <code>--latency</code>.  It used it as a way to emulate something poking my redis instance during the inital clone. The thing we, [where|are|still] worried about is customer impact, and as long as the number didn&rsquo;t sky rocket then stay high it was an acceptable risk.</p>

<p>After I got the tmux session all up and happy, i  ran these two commands to start the <code>slaveof</code>:
```bash</p>

<h1>on the master</h1>

<p>redis-master:6379> slaveof no one</p>

<h1>on the slave</h1>

<p>redis-slave:6379> slaveof redis-master 6379
```</p>

<p>It worked like a charm. The <pre>watch &ldquo;redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep master_sync_left_bytes &rdquo;</pre> started giving me data, and before I knew it I had a working master slave configuration.  This was a lot of cruft to basically say <code>slaveof redis-master 6379</code> but hell it&rsquo;s sometimes nice to see the thought process around it.  Oh!, the latency, did spike to 800 from .05, but I discovered that was in milliseconds and only ONE sample.  So yeah one call to the master with a spike of something still sub-second, was still in the risk params.
Now I have a working master slave configuration.  Next (part 2) I&rsquo;ll post about my monitoring of this, it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> exciting, but it is useful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Listening to the <a href="http://www.opscode.com">Opscode</a> comunity pod cast, the <a href="https://twitter.com/foodfightshow">foodfight</a> show, <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanwb">bryanwb</a> suggested more love for something called <a href="http://serverspec.org">serverspec</a>.  A couple days later he wrote a <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanwb/status/340155947634794496">tweet</a> and I figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot.  I&rsquo;ve been blown away by it; and I&rsquo;m going to sell/leverage it where ever I can.</p>

<p>serverspec is basically <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> for sysadmins, from what I&rsquo;ve tested basic rspec (and some advanced rspec) assertions work like a charm. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/byplayer/965857">cheat sheet</a> if you want.  You can write tests like ruby developers do, but leverage them for your infrastructure.  As I&rsquo;ve been learning more about TDD, I see the advantage, but to put that style in sysadmining, might seem initially crazy.</p>

<p>As a new sysadmin, you&rsquo;ve probably had an experience something like this:
You come in at a new job, you have the initial &ldquo;Hey newguy, here&rsquo;s your new network.  You have web machines, databases, app servers, caching servers, configuration management and other boxes. We have process monitoring <em>ahem</em>nagios<em>ahem</em> and yes we have configuration management where you have to leverage code reviews to get anything out to production.&rdquo; As a new guy I&rsquo;m excited this is great, but here comes the kicker.  Your new trainer continues, &ldquo;Ok, lets walk through each machine.  There are 10 web servers, 9 of them are called www1 through www8, and one called paco.&rdquo; You quickly grab a piece of paper, &ldquo;Paco?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yes the admin before you didn&rsquo;t like standard names, he wanted to give machines &lsquo;personality&rsquo;, and we had a management change after him, so we have that one off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is where serverspec comes into play.  You know that list that starts to grow, learning about your app servers, your one off web machines? If you use serverspec, you can keep the pseudo-english list and be able to check against what should be on there. It  gives you a way to confirm everything is exactly what you expect.</p>

<p>serverspec only requires ruby to run, the following command will get it installed if you have ruby 1.9.x+ installed. <code>gem install serverspec</code> and ssh access to the boxes you want to check.  The example of the webserver on the main page is priceless and speaks volumes. The following is that example with a small edit from me.
``` ruby
require &lsquo;spec_helper&rsquo;</p>

<p>describe package(&lsquo;httpd&rsquo;) do
  it { should be_installed }
end</p>

<p>describe service(&lsquo;httpd&rsquo;) do
  it { should be_enabled   }
  it { should be_running   }
end</p>

<p>describe port(80) do
  it { should be_listening }
end</p>

<p>describe file(&lsquo;/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf&rsquo;) do
  it { should be_file }
  it { should contain &ldquo;ServerName my-server-name&rdquo; }
end
<code>``
That's it, now all you have to do is</code>rake spec` and you have a test that checks for all the basic apache web server stuff, and instead of sshing out to each machine you can make the computer do the work for you, and this is just the tip of the iceberg!</p>

<h2>nagios (or automated process monitoring) vs serverspec</h2>

<p>I understand the hesitation about <em>another</em> monitoring solution, but every sysadmin goes through this situation like this when learning a new network.  Like the story above, there should be at least one rudimentary monitoring solution, a way to  make sure machines are up and maybe processes aren&rsquo;t erring.  With the low overhead of serverspec you can leverage this in an ad-hoc way and, I&rsquo;d like to state that this isn&rsquo;t designed to take place of something like nagios, but to augment it.</p>

<p>The advantage of something like serverspec over nagios or, a polling based monitoring solution, is that there is a lag between when you deploy something and the monitoring systems reporting it.  You can run serverspec in an ad-hoc manner you&rsquo;ll get a much faster feedback loop.  I have 1034 tests on about 40 boxes, and it only takes about 2 minutes 30 seconds to run, needless to say that&rsquo;s a small price to pay for a piece of mind.  The default polling for nagios is 5 minutes, so cutting it in half that&rsquo;s already a great turn around to see the state of the machines.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also able to get serverspec working with jenkins, and run the <code>rake</code> task every 30 minutes, and if it exits on anything other than a 0, it&rsquo;ll email out the configuration or error that it finds. I&rsquo;m still experimenting with jenkins and serverspec, but so far it&rsquo;s nice to have something other than cron running this.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>serverspec is a tool/gem that I&rsquo;ll be leveraging from now on.  I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn rspec and this gives me an avenue to use it day to day; and get a huge benefit from it.  I even bought <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book: Behaviour-Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends</a> by The Pragmatic Programmers, so hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to leverage it to get to the next level. Give it a shot, and when you get all your green dots come back, you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ve found a winner.</p>
