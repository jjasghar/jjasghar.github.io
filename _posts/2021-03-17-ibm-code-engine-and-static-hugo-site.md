# Scope

This is a tutorial/demo of getting [hugo][mainhugo] to work with [code-engine][codeengine]
from IBM Cloud.

# Prerequiesits

1. You need hugo installed, there's a few different installation paths, check [this][hugo] out.
1. Create a [GitHub][githubnew] repostiory that you can push your `hugo` site to.

# Steps

## `hugo` static site generator

1. First thing you need to do is create a example hugo site, you run the following command:
**NOTE**: `code-engine-hugo` is just an example name

```bash
$ hugo new site code-engine-hugo
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /code-engine-hugo.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
```

2. Next test your site and create a `git` repository, follow these next directions:

```bash
$ cd /code-engine-hugo
$ git init
$ git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
$ echo theme = \"ananke\" >> config.toml
$ hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
$ vim content/posts/my-first-post.md # just fill it with dummy text
$ hugo server -D
```

You should be able to see a site that says "My New Hugo Site". The `my-first-post.md`
has a `draft: true`, when you want to make it real change that to `false`.

3. Now when you make changes or add posts you can run `hugo` (without drafts) and the new site
will be recreated in `public/` in that directory.

4. Push your new site up to the GitHub repository and create the Dockerfile, and we'll start configuring
code engine next.

```bash
$ cd /code-engine-hugo
$ cat << EOF >> Dockerfile                                                                                                   [45/104]
FROM klakegg/hugo:latest

ADD . /src

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["hugo", "server", "--port", "8080"]
EOF
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "inital commit"
$ git push origin main
```

5. Just as a sanity check, lets verify that the container we have/built will work locally. Run
the following commands and to test it:

```bash
$ docker build -t jjasghar/code-engine-hugo-example .
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 jjasghar/code-engine-hugo-example:latest server
Start building sites â€¦

## code-engine serverless platform

1. Now that we have our repository on GitHub, login to the [IBM Cloud][ibmcloud]
console.

![console](../../../../../pics/codeengineconsole.png)

2. You should come to the [overview][codeengine-overview] page.

![overview](../../../../../pics/codeengineoverview.png)

3. Now take your repository from above and add it to the "Start with source code"
entry box.
And click "Start creating"

![github](../../../../../pics/codeengineoverview-github.png)

4. If you haven't created a project yet, create one where I'm pointing to, or select
one like I have as "jjtesting".

![project](../../../../../pics/codeengineoverview-project.png)

5. Scroll down and click the "Specifiy build details" and put in `/` as your
root directory. `hugo` needs to be able to find the `config.toml` file.

![builddetails](../../../../../pics/codeengineoverview-specifybuild.png)

6. Next you need to tell Code Engine where your `Dockerfile` is, this is under
the "Strategy" section of the build details:

![strategy](../../../../../pics/codeengineoverview-dockerfile.png)

7. You'll need to make sure it can see your `Dockerfile` and add your credentails
to Docker Hub. This will create a repository for you, build the container
and push this container to it. **NOTE**: The `Tag` needs to be unique.

8. Click "Done", and "Create."

Now if you open up the application URL you should have the `hugo` site!
