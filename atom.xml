    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So congrats you got your new &ldquo;<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/">Private Cloud</a>&rdquo; from Rackspace. You are probably ecstatic to start building your new machines.
I know I was; but alas with all new toys sometimes you hit a couple stags. Here are a couple things I ran into on my first few days.</p>

<h3>First issue</h3>

<p>So I&rsquo;m a chef shop, as you might now by now (assuming you&rsquo;ve read any of my other posts). I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace">knife-rackspace</a> tons of times; and hell I even have a <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-rackspace/commits?author=jjasghar">commit bit</a>. So logically I thought I could leverage this same gem with different backend api points. Nope, I was hard core wrong.
You end up having to install <a href="https://github.com/opscode/knife-openstack">knife-openstack</a>. That in itself isn&rsquo;t bad at all&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>~<span class="o">]</span> % gem install knife-openstack
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you need to update your <code>knife.rb</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>~<span class="o">]</span> % vim ~/.chef/knife.rb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In your handoff ticket, you probably got something that looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">OS_USERNAME</span><span class="o">=</span>Im_awesome_admin

</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">OS_AUTH_STRATEGY</span><span class="o">=</span>keystone:
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Go ahead and copy them out to what they need to be, something like&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Great! So run that great command <code>knife openstack flavor list</code> to see if everything works&hellip;.</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s not a lot of help eh? Turns out, if you look at the ticket that Rackspace gives you and what the <code>[:openstack_auth_url]</code> requires you&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s a <code>/tokens</code> at the end. Do&#8217;h!</p>

<h3>Second issue</h3>

<p>Ok, so you got the ability to talk to your backend? Yay! But alas, you run your create&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What the hell does that mean? Well I&rsquo;m not going to explain it all but it seems that by default Rackspace names the &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo; networks as &ldquo;Fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Floating.&rdquo;
This is triggered a fog issue, where it&rsquo;s looking at the label for a network either &ldquo;public&rdquo; or &ldquo;private&rdquo; and blows up. There is a ticket in for this <a href="https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE-231">here</a> but it looks like it&rsquo;s stalled from late summer, early fall. Lammmeeee.</p>

<p>So you are probably saying &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just rename them?&rdquo; Good for you, great idea&hellip;but no, Openstack doesn&rsquo;t support that. So at this time, it looks like you&rsquo;ll have to delete them and rebuild them with the &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;private&rdquo; names. Hopefully you&rsquo;ve noticed this at just the begining of building out your machines, otherwise you&rsquo;ll have to nuke and pave everything you&rsquo;ve done to get the new networks in.</p>

<p>Ah!, almost forgot. Before you go I should mention a quick note, notice the lowercase p in both public and private. Yes, it&rsquo;s THAT picky&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So as with all modern day &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; guys I use a SCM [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Control_Management">Source Control Management</a>] system on a daily if not hourly basis.  I&rsquo;ve been attempting to learn it more and more, and I came across this video from the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/git">/r/git</a> subreddit and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen a better explanation. It&rsquo;s called <em>Git for Ages 4 and Up</em>.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ffBJ4sVUb4 "></iframe></div>


<p>I strongly suggest taking the 99ish mins to watch it, it&rsquo;s a great tutorial, with great visual examples.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also stolen some aliases that he suggests!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Some useful notes that this video helped clear up for me:</p>

<p>Something else that finally cleared up to me <code>origin/master</code> means a label, while <code>origin master</code> means the remote origin with the label of master on it&rsquo;s remote side. This works with <code>origin/bugfix</code> and <code>origin bugfix</code> also, it&rsquo;s just unfortunate that the master is used twice is a very similar context.</p>

<p><code>git merge master</code> merges master into the current branch you have checked out. <code>git merge origin/master</code> merges the upstream changes of master into your current branch. <code>git merge master bugfix</code> merges the master branch into bugfix explicitly.</p>

<p><code>git push --set-upstream (or -u) origin bugfix</code> sets the upstream branch on origin to bugfix, if from your local repo.</p>

<p><code>refs/head/blah</code> is a fancy way of saying <code>blah</code> is the branch.</p>

<p><code>git push origin --tags</code> to push your tags on the local repo to the origin</p>

<p>A detached HEAD isn&rsquo;t a bad thing; it just means there&rsquo;s no branch associated with it. It&rsquo;s good to check things out but you can always <code>git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> if needed.</p>

<p><code>git rebase -i HEAD^^</code> go back to rebase 2 commits; rebase goes bottom up, to squash up to the top one.</p>

<p><code>rebase</code> creates a <em>new</em> line of history, not REWRITES history.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve pushed, never rebase; it&rsquo;s not worth it. :(</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I recently watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw">ChatOps</a> and got sold on <a href="http://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>.  We had him at my company for a while, but
with a migration we lost him; so I took it upon myself to learn how to use him again.  All in all getting him running inside my company was pretty straight forward, hell even getting
node to work on my local box for local development (<a href="https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814">this gist</a> sums it up nicely) wasn&rsquo;t hard at all.  I found myself wanting my own hubot for <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/meme_captain.coffee">memes</a> generation, or just to play around with.</p>

<p>So I decided hell, lets try out the <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md">heroku</a> install. It was pretty straight forward, I got my repo running, got it deployed; but I ran into an error:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ERROR Campfire request error: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is what the doc says&hellip;.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>% heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=yourcampfireaccount
</span><span class='line'>% heroku config:add HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_TOKEN=yourcampfiretoken</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I put my <code>HUBOT_CAMPEFIRE_ACCOUNT</code> name as my hubot&rsquo;s account name with the token which seems logical&hellip;wth man?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=hubotsemail@myaccountname.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I did some searching, googling, (it seems a few people had this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ERROR+Campfire+request+error%3A+Error%3A+getaddrinfo+ENOTFOUND&amp;oq=ERROR+Campfire+request+error%3A+Error%3A+getaddrinfo+ENOTFOUND&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.2689j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">issue</a>, but no fixes were posted), more reading, and it something clicked with me, maybe it&rsquo;s the actual consumer account that it connects to, not the hubot account? So I tried this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT=myaccountname.campfirenow.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Damn, nope.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Finally I started searching around actual hubot <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/issues/329">issues</a> and came across that guy. The <code>HUBOT_CAMPFIRE_ACCOUNT</code> just needed to be the subdomain. Do&#8217;h!</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/10/18/people-keep-asking-me-how-to-start-with-chef</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So as the title says, people keep asking me &ldquo;How to start with chef?&rdquo; This an outline of what, if I could go back in time, I would do from the beginning. I completely acknowledge that chef can be extremely confusing to start with. If you really want to learn it you&rsquo;ll have to stick with it, and do it. Good god, nothing is better than running it on a vagrant box and seeing what you expect happen happen.</p>

<h2>chef-solo is your best friend (step 1)</h2>

<p>A lot of people can start here, and end here believe it or not.  chef-solo is unbelievably powerful and can full-fill 90% of all requirements for basic usage. I spent some time looking around for a good tutorial (doing all of them that I could find), and <a href="http://www.opinionatedprogrammer.com/2011/06/chef-solo-tutorial-managing-a-single-server-with-chef/">this</a> on was the best &ldquo;I have no idea what the fuck I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; situation.  Modern chef installs are a tad bit different than this guy, so the &ldquo;install.sh&rdquo; changes I suggest are this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>As you can see I use the omnibus installer, not the gem, and choose the ruby version you want ;), and yes if you use those lame-ass rpm-based distros, <code>apt-get</code> won&rsquo;t work for you.</p>

<h2>There&rsquo;s something clever here (step 2)</h2>

<p>So awesome, you walked through the suggested tutorial, you can now run your <code>install.sh</code> and get your changes in. Grats! If you think about it, hit up the <a href="http://docs.opscode.com">Opscode Docs</a> and you&rsquo;ll discover that there&rsquo;s a resource to provision every which way. As I said at the beginning this might be all you need, if it is then use it; no real need to go any farther.</p>

<p>Ah, you&rsquo;re still here. So you DO want to farther, awesome. In step two I suggested going to the docs, that&rsquo;s cool, but sometimes you need more verbose help, that&rsquo;s my second point, it&rsquo;s time to start asking questions. Your first stop is <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=chef">#chef</a>; it&rsquo;s manned basically 24x7, and <em>normally</em> extremely helpful. Don&rsquo;t be a douche, if you have to paste something use <a href="http://gist.github.com">gist</a> or something.  After that the main Opscode <a href="http://lists.opscode.com/sympa">mailing list</a> is great. It&rsquo;s slower, but you get much more in depth questions and conversations. Finally the third sub step is speak up, ask questions the only way to learn this is to be like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it, help!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The only book worth a damn as of 2013/10/18 (step 3)</h2>

<p>Step three of the journey is probably the one that most people jump to initially, and this is usually where the confusion starts.  There&rsquo;s a handful of books out there on chef, this <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/chef-starter/book">one</a> is the only one worth any money.  With a strong understanding of how to provision a simple box, and where to ask questions this book will be extremely straight forward and build upon those building blocks. I&rsquo;m constantly looking for another chef bible, but most nuggets of how-to things are spread all over the internet in blog form.</p>

<h2>The fun starts here (step 4)</h2>

<p>Step four you need a chef server, you need to be able to provision multiple boxes, you understand/can find out what a role or environment is, and you need different <code>run_lists</code>.Good for you.  From here you should look at the open source <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/">chef server</a> and spin it up on another box. I should say you can use the <a href="https://getchef.opscode.com/signup">hosted chef</a>, you get up to 5 nodes with it for free, which is cool, but if you want to see everything work from the ground up, open source chef server is the way to go. (NOTE: if you are doing it in AWS/<code>$cloudprovider</code> you&rsquo;ll need at least a 4 gig box, and that&rsquo;s pushing it. You&rsquo;ve been warned.) Now spin up another box, a machine that can talk to the server that you want to provision. Start playing with <code>knife</code> add a knife plug-in for you <code>$cloudprovider</code> see if you can spin up another box using the <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/knife_bootstrap.html">knife bootstrap</a>.  Start using <a href="http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/minitest-handler">minitest-handler-cookbook</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen">test-kitchen</a>, and even <a href="https://github.com/acrmp/chefspec">chef-spec</a> if your feeling sassy. If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, you&rsquo;ve probably been exposed to a myriad of other tools, run with them. Trust me if someone built if for chef the chance of being helpful is extremely high.</p>

<h2>D&#8217;oh why did I do it this way? (step 5)</h2>

<p>Step five is pretty straight forward. GOTO 10. With everything you now have on your tool belt, you&rsquo;ll want to go back to your original chef-solo recipes and refactor everything. You&rsquo;ll want to add your minitests for integration testing to confirm everything is what you expect and much much more, that I&rsquo;m at a loss of listing out here. The only way to get good with chef is to do it, hack at it and wait for that converge to work. You&rsquo;ll probably love test-kitchen probably by this point.</p>

<p>This has been my cycle of working with chef, it&rsquo;s hard, confusing and honestly sometimes extremely annoying; though on the other hand the community is great, it&rsquo;s constantly changing, and adding great tools to make your life easier. When you finally get that recipe that builds that box exactly how you want it, theres nothing better to know it&rsquo;s always there and you never have to think about it again.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So our machines swap&hellip;.swap alot. There are the  typical nagios system checks, you can have the <code>check_swap</code> call, but at my company the &lt; 20 % hits so often we needed to figure out a way to get warned about crippling proformance. We discovered that when a machine has CPU WAIT spikes, the proformance for the machine tanks, so I tried to find a check for specificly monitor the CPU WAIT.  I should mention also that most/all of the boxes we run are VMs, and waiting on IO for swap makes a sad sysadmin.</p>

<p>I took a stab at creating a check myself and the following is a simple nagios check that you can run via NRPE.  The <code>PERCENTAGE</code> line is changeable, I&rsquo;d make sure your alarm reflects your error cases. We choose 10 % because that&rsquo;s when we started seeing real prefomance issues, but as all sysadmins know any CPU WAIT is bad in general.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you use the <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nagios">nagios cookbook</a>, and you have multiple disposable machines checking in and out of your chef-server, you might notice that running chef-client to pull new machines into nagios doesn&rsquo;t always work.  For a time my company had anything ranging from 4 to 8 machines spinning up and down, so I had to basically run chef-client on a 30 min interval to make sure I got them all. I discovered that my new machines weren&rsquo;t showing up, so I had to figure out how to &ldquo;clear the cache&rdquo; if you will.</p>

<p>Now this this is specific to  the nagios setup I have, but the <code>objects.cache</code> is what controls this.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/10/04/moving-from-one-chef-to-multiple-chefs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a organic growth of a Ops team using chef goes through.  You start out with a <code>chef_repo</code> then you post it to github/some DVCS.  From there you tell people to clone it down and put PRs against it. From there you attempt to be a gate keeper, looking at the commits in the log, realizing that there is no match ups. From there you say to yourself &ldquo;Hey, ok, these guys are pretty smart, as long as I spot check, they should be able to merge things in and I can trust them right?&rdquo; NO you are lying to yourself you just don&rsquo;t realize it yet.</p>

<p>Wait for that one day that you think you have the newest cookbook and you bump the version, add your changes and you upload, and push&hellip;and nothing happens. Oh I&rsquo;m 2x behind where I thought great, bump and push. Oh&hellip;it seems there was a critical fix in that one that I didnt get for that exact cookbook I uploaded&hellip;crap. (And other situations like this can pop up.)</p>

<p>So, I pinged <a href="https://twitter.com/nathenharvey">Nathen Harvey</a> at Opscode asking for some guidance, he suggested <a href="https://github.com/jonlives/knife-spork">knife-spork</a>.  So far with my initial tests it looks like it is the correct answer,  so I&rsquo;m also writing this as a HOWTO for my company so this is just a run down of how to use it. (A cheatsheet to the README.md if you will.)</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Obviously the first thing you need to do is install it. Luckily it&rsquo;s a gem so you can just do the following. If you read the docs there are a bunch of places that you <code>.yml</code> gets read from, but I chose this because I like having all my chef stuff in <code>.chef</code> so I don&rsquo;t have to think about pulling anything other than <code>.chef</code> if I want to move boxes.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>touch ~/.chef/spork-config.yml
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After installing the gem and touching the file, you can run <code>knife spork info</code>, it should say everything is disabled.  If so, then you are read to create the config file.</p>

<p>The example <a href="https://raw.github.com/jonlives/knife-spork/master/README.md">config</a> is on the main site, but I copied the demo one here too.</p>

<p>All in all this seems pretty self <a href="https://github.com/jonlives/knife-spork#default-environments">explanatory</a> but the most important things to change are <code>environment_path</code> and disabling the plugins (by removing them) here.  For my company I only used the git plugin and&hellip;well that was it. :)</p>

<p>By the way there are only a few plugins, <a href="https://github.com/jonlives/knife-spork/tree/master/plugins">here</a> is a link to the different .md files on each.</p>

<p>Ok, so you have everything set up, what do you do now?</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The first step is to run <code>knife spork check COOKBOOK --all</code> where COOKBOOK is one of your commonly updated/tweaked cookbooks.  Spork checks against what you have locally compared to what&rsquo;s in the server, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">knife spork check COOKBOOK --all</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Checking versions <span class="k">for </span>cookbook nagios...
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Local Version:
</span><span class='line'>  5.1.5
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>Remote Versions: <span class="o">(</span>* indicates frozen<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  5.1.5
</span><span class='line'>  5.1.4
</span><span class='line'>  5.1.3
</span><span class='line'>  5.1.2
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>ERROR: The version 5.1.5 exists on the server and is not frozen. Uploading will overwrite!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see with the error, it&rsquo;s pretty self explaintory.</p>

<p>The second step is to bump the version:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>knife spork bump nagios patch
</span><span class='line'>Git: Pulling latest changes from /Users/jasghar/repo/chef_repo/environments
</span><span class='line'>Pulling latest changes from git submodules <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">if </span>any<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>Git: Pulling latest changes from /Users/jasghar/repo/chef_repo/cookbooks/nagios
</span><span class='line'>Pulling latest changes from git submodules <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">if </span>any<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>Successfully bumped nagios to v5.1.6!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now as you can see I have the git plugin working, and it without thinking about it, updates the metadata.rb so you don&rsquo;t have to. (I HATE that part of chef, I always forget.) Now you can go off make your changes.</p>

<p>From here you&rsquo;re happy, you&rsquo;ve commited your new <code>chef_repo</code> back to the DVCS that you use.  This is where the magic happens: <code>knife spork upload COOKBOOK</code>.  This thing is great, it (to quote the <code>README.md</code>) <em>This function works mostly the same as normal knife cookbook upload COOKBOOK except that this automatically freezes cookbooks when you upload them.</em> Which is the bread and butter of spork.  The freezing is crazy important, by freezing the upload you take &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of that version of the cookbook.  Your changes are yours, and no-one can mess with them.  So in turn you don&rsquo;t step on your coworkers toes and he doesen&rsquo;t step on yours.</p>

<p>Ok, so this was the cheatsheet, we have implymented this at my company now, so hopefully this goes great. If not&hellip;well that&rsquo;s a different conversation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Monitoring</h1>

<p>Everyone loves monitoring. Ok, that&rsquo;s a lie, only [DevOps|Sysadmins] love monitoring. Ok, that&rsquo;s probably a lie too, hell I love monitoring, and I love nagios.  I&rsquo;ve followed used nagios in some shape or another since nagios-1.0b6. My first real paid job as an &ldquo;IT guy&rdquo; was setting up nagios for a company.  I&rsquo;ve actually gotten in the habit of walking into a new company using <a href="http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/07/12/serverspec-the-new-best-way-to-learn-and-audit-your-infrastructure/">serverspec</a>, to learn what each machine does, then implementing nagios behind the serverspec scripts for a proactive monitoring on error conditions. This might seem redundant, but I don&rsquo;t think so. serverspec is great for spot checking, while nagios gives the best &ldquo;state of the union&rdquo; snapshot. Granted a lot of the time creating these checks are reactive, but sometimes like here, I wrote some proactive monitoring because I know there are certain error conditions on the slaves I&rsquo;ve spun up.</p>

<p>I use nrpe to monitor my machines, and I set up my <code>nrpe.cfg</code> to something like the following. I use chef, so the <code>&lt;%= node['hostname'] %&gt;</code> is from <a href="https://github.com/opscode/ohai">ohai</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first line is pretty self explanatory.  Obviously I&rsquo;d like to check that redis is running, and that&rsquo;s what it does.</p>

<p>The second line is where I started creating the new monitoring.  I have all my monitors right now at a 3 strike out rule, I have played with the idea of tweaking it, but it seems 3 strikes then an email seems to cut down on the noise I get.</p>

<p>I stole this monitor from <a href="http://blog.winfieldpeterson.com/2012/12/13/monitoring-redis-replication-in-nagios/">here</a> but as you can tell the <code>redis-cli</code> is edited and the default status too.  <a href="https://twitter.com/miah_">Miah</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/miah/chef-redis">cookbook</a> is great, works like a charm, but it puts the <code>redis-cli</code> in <code>/opt/redis/bin/</code>.</p>

<p>As a side note: I even put in a <a href="https://github.com/miah/chef-redis/pull/55">PR</a> to update to 2.6.16, because of this project.  I ran all the <a href="https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen">test-kitchen</a> tests and it passed like a charm.  I actually learned about <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats">bats</a> in the process, and honestly I&rsquo;m pretty damn impressed with something so straight forward.  Because serverspec fulfills my requirements at the moment, I don&rsquo;t have to use it; but I like the idea of having it in my back pocket.  The replication between master and slave seems extremely important, so this monitor has been a god sent.  I never have seen it spike over 45 seconds, but then the next check pop back to &lt;3 seconds.</p>

<p>The second monitor I wrote was this:</p>

<p>This monitor I took from my typical <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/scripts/blob/master/nagios_check_generic_template.sh">bash nagios template</a> and added the error states.  It seems like the .rdb file should always be in &ldquo;close&rdquo; proximity to the last write of to slave, and it would be nice to be alarmed about it if it went out of wack.  From what I&rsquo;ve seen it&rsquo;s never more than 1 or 2 minutes behind; so this worked out.  Writing a monitor for something and never seeing it fire till there is a real problem, that&rsquo;s a great place to be in.</p>

<h2>Non-nagios monitoring</h2>

<p>I started looking around for some type of dashboard to get some visual data about the redis instance.  It turns out there is a TON of these bastards, from a paid product like <a href="https://scoutapp.com/plugin_urls/271-redis-monitoring">Scout</a> to <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/redis-stat">redis-stat</a>.  I picked redis-stat because well, it&rsquo;s un-intrusive and fast.  I have it polling against my master slave on two instances of the gem running, and it&rsquo;s really nice to have a easily digestible view of the health of it.  I have noticed that it has doubled up the info because of the syncing, so be warned, you probably should run it via just the master and then maybe put all the slaves on one? (I&rsquo;m still trying to figure this one out.)</p>

<p>If you do read this and have good suggestions please through them my <a href="http://jjasghar.github.io/about/">way</a>, the <code>INFO</code> command gives you a lot of data, and redis-stat doesn&rsquo;t store anything so treading over time isn&rsquo;t an option. I was thinking about putting some of this data in ganglia, (another favorite of mine) but to have something just redis focused seems like the correct move here.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, so far these is the monitors that I&rsquo;m using for my new master slave set up.  My next challenge is creating the VIP in front of the master slave, and have a &ldquo;hot fail over.&rdquo; This is going to require some pretty interesting engineering; it&rsquo;s fun, but man the more I think about it the more it hurts my brain.  So I haven&rsquo;t actually talked about the migration yet either.  From what I&rsquo;ve understood it seems that 2.4.16 is actually <em>inside</em> 2.6.16, so if I get this VIP in front of this master slave then fail over to the slave turning off the read-only, this should be seamless. I need to do some testing; but that seems like the best course of action. For just the migration though, the &ldquo;hot fail over&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t required, but I want it to be in the fore-front of the design because I&rsquo;d rather be additive than have to rip out everything after we get up dated.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/09/30/adventures-migrating-from-2-dot-4-16-redis-to-2-dot-6-16-redis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like most sysadmins out there, I read the blogs and posts about new technologies that are relevant to my product(s).  There has been a lot of buzz about NoSQL and the key value store type db&rsquo;s out there, yet I have never really focused directly on it.  I have paid passing attention, until I realized that we use one heavily at my company.</p>

<p><a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> is a key value store that runs completely in memory. It&rsquo;s fast, REALLY fast, and after spending some time with a few tutorials like <a href="http://openmymind.net/2012/1/23/The-Little-Redis-Book/">The Little Redis Book</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/karlseguin">Karl Seguin</a>, it makes a ton of sense, and an extremely neat backend piece of software.</p>

<p>I started to learn more about it, and I started talking to a coworker and he said that he really wanted to upgrade from 2.4 redis to 2.6 redis. I took this as a challenge, and ran with it.</p>

<p>The first part of the migration is creating a slave.  We had .aof and .rdb snapshotting, but we didn&rsquo;t have a slave. This post is be going to be chronicling my adventures getting from 2.4.16 to 2.6.16.</p>

<p>Another coworker of mine, <a href="https://github.com/lwoodson">Lance Woodson</a>, created a script called &ldquo;<a href="https://gist.github.com/jjasghar/423d040444a4f4cbea1d">bloater</a>&rdquo; to start putting trash keys in the redis db.  As you can see it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward, I do strongly suggest using <code>bloater.clear!</code> if you are playing with it.  I leveraged this to simulate creating a slave already in production, the theory being I&rsquo;ll have data inside the redis db, things talking to db, and the sync happening.  I understand that a lot of people have tested this situation, but I couldn&rsquo;t seem to find any direct examples.  Hopefully this will be useful to someone.</p>

<p>The first step after getting my 2.4.16 redis machine running, I ran <code>bloater.bloat! 2295000000</code> to get an .rdb file that was ~2 gigs.  I configured the snapshotting at the default values so it created it without a hitch.  I copied it off called it something like <code>2gig-dump.rdb</code> or something.  Then I ran <code>bloater.bloat! 4295000000</code> to create the 4gig dump file.  I copied that off next and then I had my two dumpfiles that I could play with.  You are probably wondering why 2 and 4 gigs, and also &ldquo;Dang, that&rsquo;s a huge redis db.&rdquo; Yes, yes it is, I focused on the &ldquo;oh crap, our db is too big&rdquo; situation, so if redis handles that, then I know it&rsquo;ll deal with the 100 meg db just fine.</p>

<p>Secondly I did my <code>FLUSHALL</code> command, then shutdown my redis instance then copied the 2 gig db, in the <code>/var/lib/redis/</code> location.  I spun up redis, and ran the <code>INFO</code> command, like all redis admins learn to love to do.  I saw that it was 2 gigs, and yay, now I had my foundation to start my testing.</p>

<p>I went through quite a few different iterations, but I&rsquo;ll just explain the basic trouble shooting that I did, and maybe you can leverage off it.</p>

<p>So with my redis 2.4 instance with a 2 gig db, and my 2.6 blank db instance it was time to start the fun.  I ran the following commands in a tmux session on my main workstation.  I liked the idea of a 3rd party machine actually looking at all this stuff instead of running directly on one of the machines.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>watch <span class="s2">&quot;redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep master_sync_left_bytes &quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>redis-cli -h redis-slave keys <span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span> | wc -l
</span><span class='line'>redis-cli -h redis-master keys <span class="s2">&quot;*&quot;</span> | wc -l
</span><span class='line'>redis-cli -h redis-master info | grep used_memory
</span><span class='line'>redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep used_memory
</span><span class='line'>redis-cli -h redis-master --latency
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Most, if not all are pretty self explanatory.  The most interesting one of them all is probably the last one, the <code>--latency</code>.  It used it as a way to emulate something poking my redis instance during the inital clone. The thing we, [where|are|still] worried about is customer impact, and as long as the number didn&rsquo;t sky rocket then stay high it was an acceptable risk.</p>

<p>After I got the tmux session all up and happy, i  ran these two commands to start the <code>slaveof</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># on the master</span>
</span><span class='line'>redis-master:6379&gt; slaveof no one
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># on the slave</span>
</span><span class='line'>redis-slave:6379&gt; slaveof redis-master 6379
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It worked like a charm. The <code>watch "redis-cli -h redis-slave info | grep master_sync_left_bytes "</code> started showing me the amount of data left for the transfer, and before I knew it I had a working master slave configuration.  This was a lot of cruft to basically say <code>slaveof redis-master 6379</code> but hell it&rsquo;s sometimes nice to see the thought process around it.  Oh!, the latency, did spike to 800 from .05, but I discovered that was in milliseconds and only ONE sample.  So yeah one call to the master with a spike of something still sub-second, was still in the risk params.
Now I have a working master slave configuration.  Next (part 2) I&rsquo;ll post about my monitoring of this, it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> exciting, but it is useful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;d like to start off by thanking Darren Jones, for writing the book <a href="http://sitepoint.com/jumpstart-sinatra">Jump Start Sinatra</a>.  This book is amazing, it&rsquo;s extremely well written, straight forward and hands on. Darren was able to break down and explain how sinatra works, runs and what you can do with it in a rapid fire primer.</p>

<p>Darren has you create a simple &ldquo;sinatra song web site&rdquo; with a database backed, css, javascript (via coffeescript), and even gets you to post to heroku.  The book is only about 166 pages long, and fast, but gives you the primer to understand what you need to get done to make a functional app with little trouble and overhead. With in the first couple chapters Darren spurred me to wonder how a json object with curl POST was able to be put the data into a db, and with the this tutorial Darren has opened the avenue for me to be able to figure it out.</p>

<p>One issue that I had with the book, it doesn&rsquo;t you how to write tests against the app you create.  Due to new programming practices, this seems like a nasty gap.  I&rsquo;ve decided before I figure out how to get my json input output working, I&rsquo;m going to figure out how to write tests against the app I created.</p>

<p>If you are curious on the app that is built from this book, I have posted it <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/sinatra_song_app">here</a>, but as time progresses I&rsquo;ll probably add things to it. Fair warning there.</p>

<p>Dang you really do learn something new every day.</p>

<p>Note: A good friend of mine <a href="https://github.com/awaxa/">awaxa</a> pointed out that {1..10} is the fastest in this case because it&rsquo;s a built into bash.  Thanks awaxa!</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/08/02/adventures-with-chef-solo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started my chef career with inheriting a chef infrastructure with an opensource chef server.  I read all of the blog posts, and the tutorials, tried to wrap my head around what a cookbook, recipe, or data bag was.  I know now, this was the <em>wrong</em> way to learn chef.  chef with chef-client/server adds a level of complexity that just is unfounded.  I decided to spend a copy hours to master chef-solo, and damn I wish I had started there.</p>

<h2>My hands on learning project</h2>

<p>I had a requirement of setting up a unicorn nginx instance on a VPS.  I thought hell, there&rsquo;s gotta be a way to do this with chef. (I normally use passenger+apache, so I had to learn nginx and unicorn too, but that&rsquo;s a different post&hellip;well kinda) So I looked around for a nice <a href="http://www.opinionatedprogrammer.com/2011/06/chef-solo-tutorial-managing-a-single-server-with-chef/">tutorial</a> and came across that guy.  I started reading it, realized holy crap, this is awesome.  I stole the <code>solo.json</code> and the <code>solo.rb</code> and <code>install.sh</code> because I was lazy.<br/>
I changed the <code>install.sh</code> around a little bit:</p>

<p>As you can tell, its ubuntu focused, but basically if I want to provision a box after making a change to one of the cookbooks I just had to run <code>./install.sh</code>.  Interestingly, I had heard bad things about the 1.9.1 ruby binaries for ubuntu, but so far, it is a ton better than doing that compile from src. ;)</p>

<p>So, basically with those three files, running that curl in the script, and creating a <code>cookbooks/</code> directory, I had my framework to make this project happen.</p>

<p>Now I made a mistake here.  I started off with a simple &ldquo;generic&rdquo; cookbook, with a simple <code>default.rb</code> file that called a <code>packages.rb</code> file to add some pkgs I love and run on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Now to an passive onlooker there seems nothing wrong with this, and 3 weeks ago JJ would agree with you.  JJ now says, &ldquo;Stop that, start with the webserver and the deps for that instead of the convince of something easy like package management.&rdquo;  LEARN <a href="http://berkshelf.com/">berkshelf</a> and don&rsquo;t make excuses. (at this writing, 8/2/13, I still actually haven&rsquo;t learned it, the best analogy is this, dling cookbooks is like building from source, and berkshelf is like using apt-get) Anyway I digress.</p>

<p>Back to the original story.</p>

<p>I made the <code>cookbooks/</code> directory, and when to github to pull down the newest <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx">nginx</a> cookbook.  <code>git clone https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx.git</code> in the directory and then because  I hate submodules, I ran <code>rm -rf .git/</code>. I <code>cd ~/chef-solo</code> then ran <code>install.sh</code>. Crossed my fingers and no, didn&rsquo;t work. Turns out I needed a bunch of dependences (hence the berkself statement). I resolved them all, and then ran the beautiful <code>./install.sh</code>. BOOM, it worked.  I took a moment, realized what I had just done.  I created a git repo off this work, created a branch &ldquo;nginx&rdquo; and committed my changes. Now whenever I need to spin up an nginx box, all I have to do is clone my chef-solo repo and checkout nginx and run <code>install.sh</code>.</p>

<p>Dang, that&rsquo;s awesome. To get that to work with chef-server&hellip;is a ton of work.  You have to download each cookbook, upload each to the chef-server, change the role or add the recipe, then run chef-client.  This would be great if I had to do it over and over, but being I was just setting up a dev box, chef-server overhead just isn&rsquo;t worth it.</p>

<p>Now all in all, this has only been one adventure with chef-solo, but going through this academic exercise I realized the potential of this unbelievable powerful application.  From this project, and my &ldquo;generic&rdquo; cookbook, I&rsquo;ve ran with it, so now I have a boostrap cookbook with my packages, some of my dotfiles, and other tidbits.  It&rsquo;s nice, and I strongly suggest checking it out.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/07/12/serverspec-the-new-best-way-to-learn-and-audit-your-infrastructure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Listening to the <a href="http://www.opscode.com">Opscode</a> comunity pod cast, the <a href="https://twitter.com/foodfightshow">foodfight</a> show, <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanwb">bryanwb</a> suggested more love for something called <a href="http://serverspec.org">serverspec</a>.  A couple days later he wrote a <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanwb/status/340155947634794496">tweet</a> and I figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot.  I&rsquo;ve been blown away by it; and I&rsquo;m going to sell/leverage it where ever I can.</p>

<p>serverspec is basically <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> for sysadmins, from what I&rsquo;ve tested basic rspec (and some advanced rspec) assertions work like a charm. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/byplayer/965857">cheat sheet</a> if you want.  You can write tests like ruby developers do, but leverage them for your infrastructure.  As I&rsquo;ve been learning more about TDD, I see the advantage, but to put that style in sysadmining, might seem initially crazy.</p>

<p>As a new sysadmin, you&rsquo;ve probably had an experience something like this:
You come in at a new job, you have the initial &ldquo;Hey newguy, here&rsquo;s your new network.  You have web machines, databases, app servers, caching servers, configuration management and other boxes. We have process monitoring <em>ahem</em>nagios<em>ahem</em> and yes we have configuration management where you have to leverage code reviews to get anything out to production.&rdquo; As a new guy I&rsquo;m excited this is great, but here comes the kicker.  Your new trainer continues, &ldquo;Ok, lets walk through each machine.  There are 10 web servers, 9 of them are called www1 through www8, and one called paco.&rdquo; You quickly grab a piece of paper, &ldquo;Paco?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yes the admin before you didn&rsquo;t like standard names, he wanted to give machines &lsquo;personality&rsquo;, and we had a management change after him, so we have that one off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is where serverspec comes into play.  You know that list that starts to grow, learning about your app servers, your one off web machines? If you use serverspec, you can keep the pseudo-english list and be able to check against what should be on there. It  gives you a way to confirm everything is exactly what you expect.</p>

<p>serverspec only requires ruby to run, the following command will get it installed if you have ruby 1.9.x+ installed. <code>gem install serverspec</code> and ssh access to the boxes you want to check.  The example of the webserver on the main page is priceless and speaks volumes. The following is that example with a small edit from me.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, now all you have to do is <code>rake spec</code> and you have a test that checks for all the basic apache web server stuff, and instead of sshing out to each machine you can make the computer do the work for you, and this is just the tip of the iceberg!</p>

<h2>nagios (or automated process monitoring) vs serverspec</h2>

<p>I understand the hesitation about <em>another</em> monitoring solution, but every sysadmin goes through this situation like this when learning a new network.  Like the story above, there should be at least one rudimentary monitoring solution, a way to  make sure machines are up and maybe processes aren&rsquo;t erring.  With the low overhead of serverspec you can leverage this in an ad-hoc way and, I&rsquo;d like to state that this isn&rsquo;t designed to take place of something like nagios, but to augment it.</p>

<p>The advantage of something like serverspec over nagios or, a polling based monitoring solution, is that there is a lag between when you deploy something and the monitoring systems reporting it.  You can run serverspec in an ad-hoc manner you&rsquo;ll get a much faster feedback loop.  I have 1034 tests on about 40 boxes, and it only takes about 2 minutes 30 seconds to run, needless to say that&rsquo;s a small price to pay for a piece of mind.  The default polling for nagios is 5 minutes, so cutting it in half that&rsquo;s already a great turn around to see the state of the machines.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also able to get serverspec working with jenkins, and run the <code>rake</code> task every 30 minutes, and if it exits on anything other than a 0, it&rsquo;ll email out the configuration or error that it finds. I&rsquo;m still experimenting with jenkins and serverspec, but so far it&rsquo;s nice to have something other than cron running this.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>serverspec is a tool/gem that I&rsquo;ll be leveraging from now on.  I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn rspec and this gives me an avenue to use it day to day; and get a huge benefit from it.  I even bought <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book: Behaviour-Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends</a> by The Pragmatic Programmers, so hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to leverage it to get to the next level. Give it a shot, and when you get all your green dots come back, you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ve found a winner.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-09T15:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/07/09/nagios-status-rackspace</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I posted a <a href="http://redd.it/1gefnf">this</a> on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin">/r/sysadmin/</a> back on 6/15/13.  I wanted to put some context around why I created the nagios checks and why the <a href="https://status.rackspace.com/index/rss">RSS</a> after all that discussion still didn&rsquo;t fulfill my requirements.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I have with the RSS feed is that it is everything inside the rackspace status page.  As I said to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/rackerkev">/u/rackerkev</a>; as a customer in ORD I don&rsquo;t want to be paged or alerted when something in LON happens.  This seems be the default for the RSS feed, a water hose of what that status page says.</p>

<p>After our account manager suggested us to check <a href="http://status.rackspace.com">http://status.rackspace.com</a> a developer on my team asked if there was an automated way to check this.  I ran a quick <code>curl http://status.rackspace.com</code> and discovered it&rsquo;s flat html.  Boom, I had a way to get the data, I just needed a way to parse it.</p>

<p>I had a default nagios check template and all I had to do was put that <code>curl</code> in to parse it out.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this actually works, but hell you get the point.</p>

<p>So with some patience using <code>sed</code> and <code>grep</code> I was able to start parsing out the data for my back ends specifically.  I ended up parsing out each section so you could have London Next-Gen and Rackconnect General.  I had a couple posts about &ldquo;You should write it as one script and then add flags or variables at the end.&rdquo; I disagree, I wrote this so it could be dropped in nagios, straight forward install with little to no overhead.  As long as you have <code>curl</code> installed and write the command stanza, like my suggestion in the <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/nagios-status-rackspace/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> you should be off to the races.</p>

<p>Now something interesting I learned posting these checks.  The quote that says &ldquo;rackspace only updates the status page if enough customers complain about some problem some place&rdquo; is true.  There is no automated update to the status page, it requires human intervention to update.  When I first heard of the status page, I like most though it was programmatic way to see into rackspace infrastructure.  This makes me a sad panda; and as I have learned the best way to get anything done with rackspace is to call yell and yell more.</p>

<p>First off, I&rsquo;m going to say I&rsquo;m a chef zealot, but I&rsquo;m attempting to put together an intelligent discussion of the battle that has popped up in sysadmin discussion groups now-a-days.  Secondly, I&rsquo;m only focusing on the three systems I have exposure to, ansible the least, puppet the second, and chef the most.  I could also probably throw salt, cfengine, and others in there, but that&rsquo;s superfluous, this is my discussion so I&rsquo;m going to keep it in my scope.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going focus on the pluses of each, and use the &ldquo;Overall&rdquo; section to combine them.  In my conclusion my true thoughts will come out, so if you want the tl;dr I&rsquo;d skip down there.</p>

<h2>ansible</h2>

<p>Links:
<a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/">homepage</a>, a great <a href="https://github.com/leucos/ansible-tuto">tutorial</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Low overhead</li>
<li>python based</li>
<li>playbook based</li>
</ul>


<p>To quote Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ansible is an open-source software platform for configuring and managing computers. It combines multi-node software deployment, ad-hoc task execution, and configuration management. It manages nodes over SSH and does not require any additional remote software to be installed on them. Modules work over JSON and standard output and can be written in any programming language. The system uses YAML to express reusable descriptions of systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Probably the neatest thing about ansible is that it only requires ssh to work.  You do the work on a local box, and run the &ldquo;play book&rdquo; and it walks through the steps.  its designed to be something fast and quick to spin up boxes.  The disadvantage of this is that creep can happen; you can make sure the box is what you expect but you don&rsquo;t have the focused control of something like chef or puppet.  If you need just a webserver that is configured one way and is disposable then this is the way to go.  If you have to support something for long term though, it seems its out of scope of this product. I could be wrong but that&rsquo;s how I interperat it.</p>

<h2>chef</h2>

<p>Links:
<a href="http://www.opscode.com/">homepage</a>, a great <a href="https://learnchef.opscode.com/">tutorial</a></p>

<ul>
<li>gem or <a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2012/06/29/omnibus-chef-packaging/">omnibus</a> installer</li>
<li>server based or <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html">chef-solo</a></li>
<li>cookbook or recipe based</li>
</ul>


<p>To quote Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><p>chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang. It uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configuration &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; or &ldquo;cookbooks&rdquo;. chef was written by Opscode and is released as open source under the Apache License 2.0. chef is a DevOps tool used for configuring cloud services or to streamline the task of configuring a company&rsquo;s internal servers. chef automatically sets up and tweaks the operating systems and programs that run in massive data centers.</p></blockquote>

<p>As I said in the intro, I love chef.  Hell if I could I&rsquo;d probably work for opscode.  As soon as I got my head wrapped around chef (which is chef&rsquo;s main problem), its quick and efficient, and its slick.  I&rsquo;ve only ever used chef with a chef server, never really touched chef-solo.  I also leveraged <a href="https://github.com/jkeiser/chef-zero">chef-zero</a> in my testing because I like the idea of uploading the cookbooks and pulling them down.  Having cookbooks on a centralized chef server, its a true &ldquo;system of record&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t rely on your laptop or workstation, if you do a <code>knife server create 'role[web]'</code> you know what you are going to get.</p>

<p>Something I would like to say though, a huge disadvantage of chef is the way cookbooks are controlled.  It requires constant babying, or plugins like <a href="https://github.com/jonlives/knife-spork">knife-spork</a> to make sure people don&rsquo;t mess with each others work.  I am lucky enough to work in an environment with only 2 others that have any real use for chef, so I am able to be a good gatekeeper.  I could only imagine the cluster with larger teams.  As of 6/26/13 I know this is a conversation topic and pain point, I&rsquo;d be interested to see how the workflow matures.</p>

<h2>puppet</h2>

<p>Links:
<a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/">homepage</a>, a great <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet_core_types_cheatsheet.pdf">cheat sheet</a></p>

<ul>
<li>an official <a href="http://info.puppetlabs.com/download-learning-puppet-VM.html">learning</a> vm</li>
<li><a href="https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source/">package</a> based</li>
<li>server based or local puppet-apply</li>
<li>manifest based</li>
</ul>


<p>To quote Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><p>puppet is a tool designed to manage the configuration of Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems declaratively. The user describes system resources and their state, either using puppet&rsquo;s declarative language or a Ruby DSL (domain-specific language). This information is stored in files called &ldquo;puppet manifests&rdquo;. puppet discovers the system information via a utility called Facter, and compiles the puppet manifests into a system-specific catalog containing resources and resource dependency, which are applied against the target systems. Any actions taken by puppet are then reported.</p></blockquote>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve always loved about puppet is the trifecta. You can easily create a manifest to control the package/file/service in only a few lines.  (check that cheat sheet above for an example) I was able to take over an infrastructure in an extremely short period of time with just that.  I didn&rsquo;t have that long to control every facet of the groupings but the investment to the reward was mind boggling fast.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Ok, now that my little tl;dr of the pluses are done, I can start my views overall.  puppet is a very &ldquo;eins, zwei, eins, zwei,&rdquo; type application.  With marrying it with something like <a href="http://www.cobblerd.org/">cobbler</a> you can in theory rack mount a machine, hit the power button and have a machine exactly how you want it to be in &ldquo;x&rdquo; about of time.  This is great for big companies that always want machines to cookie cutter. It could be that that&rsquo;s how I saw puppet being used, but comparing them to the two other config management systems; it really fits. Speaking of cobbler, yes, I do understand you can leverage cobbler with each of these tools, but as you can <a href="https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/wiki/Using%20cobbler%20with%20a%20configuration%20management%20system">see</a> it just seems that cobbler and puppet are a match made in heaven.  chef on the other hand seems like it&rsquo;s designed for smaller companies with smaller teams.  It looks for cooperation, nay, requires cooperation, and its to its strength and its weakness.  Unlike puppet, chef doesn&rsquo;t default to an &ldquo;active&rdquo; mode (Ok, that&rsquo;s not fully true about puppet either, but the better practice is to have puppet in active mode from the get go).  puppet runs by default every 30 mins, to make sure its what you want to be, chef on the other hand is a pull based config-management that they even suggest &ldquo;putting chef-client&rdquo; in your crontab.  This originally bothered me, coming from the puppet world, but as i learned more about chef i realized that isn&rsquo;t its bread and butter.  chef is a way to spin up boxes for an elastic environment like AWS.  You have a massive blast of traffic, chef will trigger throw your machines in the load balancer, install apache or whatever, and you have what you expect, and 2-3 hours later you blow it away.  This is different than ansible because it is not &ldquo;automated&rdquo; per se. Remember the play books site in your local machine, you have interact with the provisioning, which for a startup seems like the correct path. In a startup you have to know exactly what machines are running, not only because of OPEX but because its your baby, you want focus and tweak; you <em>probably</em> don&rsquo;t have the budget to just blow away the boxes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So I&rsquo;ll say this because I believe this: each of these tools are for different &ldquo;size&rdquo; infrastructures.  You can argue as much as you want; saying that &ldquo;yes well you can use each in of the different sizes&rdquo;, but they were all seem to have a natural fit.  puppet for the corporate/enterprise space, chef for the the small corporate/budding-enterprise space, and ansible for the start ups.</p>

    <id>http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/06/25/chef-jenkins-vagrant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To quote the top of my <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/chef-jenkins-vagrant/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is my &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; on how I got Chef Jenkins and Vagrant to play nice. After watching this (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_IEfNklzW4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_IEfNklzW4</a>) video, I realized I could do this. I searched high and low for a tutorial on how to bulid this stack, and nothing. So I decided to create a github doc to centralize my setup and hopefully let the community suggest additions.</p></blockquote>

<p>I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/bscott">Brian Scott</a>, because after his video it really opened my eyes.  I&rsquo;ve now had 3 people run through this tutorial and all come out with a working <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/chef-jenkins-vagrant">chef-jenkins-vagrant</a> set ups and learned to extend it to where I had never thought of.</p>

<p>I understand and that a lot of people wonder why someone would want to build this from scratch, instead of using, for instance <a href="https://github.com/fnichol">Fletcher Nichol&rsquo;s</a> <em>ahem</em><a href="https://github.com/jamie-ci/jamie">jamie-ci</a><em>ahem</em> test-kitchen, and this is what I&rsquo;m going to write about.</p>

<p>I see <a href="https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen">test-kitchen</a> is more for writing cookbooks and recipes for the general public.  You can easily create faux VMs, per <a href="https://github.com/sethvargo">Seth Vergo&rsquo;s</a> awesome <a href="https://github.com/customink/fauxhai">fauxhai</a> to test cookbooks across multiple setups and multiple provisioned systems to see if they work.  This is great for developing a cookbooks but I can&rsquo;t see it working in a sysadmins workflow.</p>

<p>Sysadmins have a select few boxes; they have their known quantities, they know they aren&rsquo;t going to have RHEL/DEB/tar based machines.  They build infrastructures to have uniformity, they stick with one of them.  Granted, some of the sysadmnis out there are unlucky and DO have these environments, but I truly believe that&rsquo;s the minority not the majority.</p>

<p>A sysadmin needs a way to provision his machines, in a safe manner before pushing changes out to production. This sounds obvious, but how many places I&rsquo;ve been where have I heard &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just an /etc/hosts file update, just push it out.&rdquo;  Just yesterday, (06/25/2013) as I was victim if that short cut and caused an outage to some our backend machines.  If you are curious, it seems, we had a hardcoded IP to DNS name in /etc/hosts (not DNS) that was required for our application to work.  If I held true to my statements earlier I would have noticed this change from my CI builds and not looked like the dumbass I was.</p>

<p>I built this <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar/chef-jenkins-vagrant">chef-jenkins-vagrant</a> howto so I don&rsquo;t have an excuse anymore, I have a proven way to build and implement good practices in an quick manner.  I hope you find it useful, and if you have suggestions or additions PRs are always welcome.</p>
